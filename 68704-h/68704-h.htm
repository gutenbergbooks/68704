  <h2 class='c006'>TO THE READER.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>I Have been desired by several Friends, to set
forth the Interpretation concerning the Witch
of <i>Endor</i> and King <i>Saul</i>; how it may be
understood how she raised <i>Samuel</i>, and how
Familiar Spirits came to be procured, and with
what Power they do such strange Things.
Many Enemies also have objected this Place,
to prove that Spirits may be raised without Bodies,
and that Spirits may walk, or be happy or
miserable without Bodies: Though I have given
an Answer in Discourse to these Doubts and
Questions, but few can retain in their Memory
what is spoken in Discourse; therefore I thought
it convenient and necessary to set it forth in
Print, for the Information and Satisfaction of
many Friends who desire it, and for the Convincement
of all Gain-sayers. And let them
seriously read it over without Prejudice, and they
may see this Point clearly opened, which hath
laid hid this many Hundred Years, with other
Places of Scriptures opened, which many have
objected against this Interpretation, and all those
Places of Scripture that is commonly brought, or
doth most seem to hold forth, that Spirits may
be without Bodies, are likewise opened and expounded
in short in this Treatise, as followeth.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_1'></a>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. I. <br /> 1 <span class='sc'>Sam.</span> XXVIII. <i>from the 11th to the 18th Verse</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>I Shall give the Interpretation, what is meant by
that Familiar Spirit the Witch of <i>Endor</i> which did
raise <i>Samuel</i>, so much spoken of in the Book of <i>Samuel</i>,
and other Places of Scripture; and so much objected
by many to prove that Spirits may be raised
without Bodies, and may appear unto People in
what Shape they please.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Belief of this lying Principle, it did proceed out of the Imagination
of Reason, the Devil&mdash;&mdash;The Imagination that doth arise or
proceed from the Seed of Reason in Man, is that Familiar Spirit that
Witches deal with, and that Familiar Spirit it proceedeth from no
Spirit or Devil without a Man, but from the Seed of Reason within
Man; for look what evil Thoughts doth arise out of the Heart of
Man, it proceedeth out of the Seed of Reason in Man, and not from
any thing without Man; for the Imagination of the Heart, it is plac'd
in the Seed of Reason, therefore it is said in Scripture, <i>That the Imaginations
of Man's Heart was evil, and that every Imagination of the
Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually</i>, as in <i>Gen.</i> vi. 5. So that
there is no other Devil, or Spirit, or Familiar Spirit for Witches to
deal withal, or to work any Enchantments by, but their own Imagination;
<a id='Page_2'></a>there the Familiar Spirit is produced from whence it came,
and there it ceases to be when they are put to Death, or over-power'd
by the Knowledge, and the Power of Faith in other Men, then the Familiar
Spirit centers in the Imagination again, it being over-powered
by the Power of Faith; so likewise, the good Thoughts that doth
proceed out of the Heart of Man, they do arise or proceed from the
Seed of Faith, concerning the true God, or any heavenly Secret, or
temporal Judgments, or temporal Blessings; if the Foreknowledge
of these Things doth arise, or be foretold by the Revelation of the
Seed of Faith, they are and may be called the Spirit of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>Because they were foretold and declared by the Revelation of the
Seed of Faith, which Seed of Faith is the Seed of God, it being of
God's own Nature, therefore called the Spirit of God, and so foretold
and declared by the Spirit of God: So likewise, what Foreknowledge
or Declaration of Things, that are above that which is common
to the Seed of Reason, (as raising of Spirits and such like;) I say,
they do proceed from the Imagination of Reason, the Devil; and this
strong Imagination from the Seed of Reason, is that Familiar Spirit
by which Witches do divine or foretel Things. So that the strong
Imagination of Reason, being exercised about Things that are beyond
Trades and Sciences, that are necessary, needful, and lawful; so it
becomes a Familiar Spirit, because it proceeds from the imagination
of Reason, and the Seed of Reason being the Devil, and the Devil
being the fallen Angel; for the Devil is Man and Woman; and the
Seed of Reason is their Seed. And that Seed of Reason it came from,
that Serpent that beguiled <i>Eve</i>; and that Serpent was an Angel, and
his Seed was Reason, and this Reason in Man is the Devil; and the
Imagination of Reason is the Father of that Familiar Spirit, by which
a Man or Woman doth Divine, Soothsay, raise Shapes, or hear Voices,
or any such Thing of that Nature, they all proceed from the Imagination
of Reason in Man, and the original Being of this Seed of Reason.
It came from that Serpent-Angel, that was cast down from
Heaven unto this Earth, who deceived our first Parents, as I have
abundantly shewed in <i>Rev.</i> xi. and in the Interpretation of the whole
Book of the <i>Revelation</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now I have laid a Foundation for the Reader, that he may the better
understand the Foundation, from whence these Familiar Spirits
that Witches have, do proceed, and how they are procured, and
what Power they have over the ignorant Mind of Man; therefore
to satisfy the Thoughts of many, who hath desired and requested of
me, that I would interpret some chief Sayings in the Scriptures, that
<a id='Page_3'></a>speaketh of Witchcraft, and Familiar Spirits, and such like; which
Sayings are very strange and hard to be understood; so that most People
are very much unsatisfied in these Things, though clear in their
Judgments, in many other Things that are of more Concernment. And
as I have given the Interpretation of the whole Book of the <i>Revelation</i>,
with many other Places of Scripture, to the great Comfort and Satisfaction
of many, so I shall add the Interpretation of this thing also.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first Place of Scripture I shall insist upon, is that in 1 <i>Sam.</i> xxviii.
beginning at the 11th Verse, concerning the Witch of <i>Endor</i>; this
is commonly the Place that most People fetch to prove, that Spirits
may be raised in what Shape the Witch please by their Familiar Spirits;
therefore let the Reader mind the Discourse that followeth. The
Words are these, <i>Then said the Woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee?
And he said, bring me up</i> Samuel. And in the 12th Verse, <i>And when
the Woman saw</i> Samuel, <i>she cried with aloud Voice, and the Woman spake
to</i> Saul, <i>saying, why hast thou deceived me, for thou art</i> Saul? And in
the 13th Verse, <i>And the King said unto her, be not afraid, for what
sawest thou? And the Woman said unto</i> Saul, <i>I saw Gods ascending out
of the Earth</i>. The 14th Verse, <i>And he said unto her, what Form is he of?
And she said, an old Man cometh up, and he is covered with a Mantle.
And</i> Saul <i>perceived it was</i> Samuel, <i>and he stooped with his Face to the
Ground, and bowed himself</i>. The 15th Verse, <i>And</i> Samuel <i>said to</i> Saul,
<i>Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up? And</i> Saul <i>answered, I am
sore distressed: For the</i> Philistines <i>make War against me, and God is departed
from me, and answereth me no more, neither by Prophet, nor by Dreams:
Therefore I have called thee, that thou mayst make known unto me what I
shall do</i>. Verse 16. <i>Then said</i> Samuel, <i>Wherefore then dost thou ask of me,
seeing the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine Enemy?</i> Verse
17. <i>And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me; for the Lord hath
rent the Kingdom out of thine Hand, and given it to thy Neighbour, even
to</i> David. Verse 18. <i>Because thou obeyest not the Voice of the Lord, nor
executed his fierce Wrath upon</i> Amalek; <i>therefore hath the Lord done this
Thing unto thee this Day</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. II.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>This Familiar Spirit the Witch of <i>Endor</i> and other Witches
have, whereby they do such Things, it is the Imagination of
Reason, the Devil in themselves; that is, they set themselves apart
with the Thoughts of the Imaginations of their Hearts, to dive into
<a id='Page_4'></a>the diabolical Power; that is, that they might know the Depths of
Satan, their Imagination conceiving that the Devil is a Spirit flying
in the Air, and that this Spirit can assume or take up any Shape it
please. So that the Imagination of the Heart hath produced an evil
Spirit in it self, so that this Familiar Spirit is begotten out of the
Womb of Reason: For the Seed of Reason in Man is the Womb or
the Mother, and the Imagination of the Heart is the Father that
begets this Familiar Spirit, and this Familiar Spirit is the Son of
Imagination. So that all Thoughts of the Heart, and that wonderful
Knowledge declared by them, it is revealed through this Son the Familiar
Spirit, begotten in themselves by the Seed of Reason the Mother,
and Imagination the Father. So that there is no Devil, nor
Familiar Spirit without them, as People do vainly imagine, but the
Devil and Familiar Spirit is always within them, and no where else;
yet all People fear a Devil without them, but he is no where to be
found but in Man and Woman, this I do certainly know to be true.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, These Witches doth suppose the true God to be an Infinite
Spirit, without any Body or Substance, as all People almost do; and
that the Devil is a Spirit that can assume Bodies or what Shape he
pleaseth, or what Shape or Form the Witch shall call for. This is
the Opinion of most People in the World as well as Witches, yea,
even of the most of the greatest learned Men; Darkness hath overspread
the Minds of all learned Men in the World, so that they cannot
find out what the true God is, nor where he is; nor what the
right Devil is, nor where he is; yea Man, himself is he that cannot
find out himself: But no more of this now.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the Matter in hand, the Witches they do not know any Divine
Being, or Power, or Form of God, but what their Imagination doth
conceive to be God, for they have full Faith in this Knowledge of
theirs, to be the true Knowledge of God; only the Laws of Men
they fear, but no other God, but that Familiar Spirit which they
have produced in themselves, by giving themselves either to Fasting
and Prayer, unto an unknown Divine Being or Power; supposing this
Power to be a Spirit that can appear in any Shape they shall call for
or desire. And all People being ignorant of the true God, and the
right Devil, as they themselves are, so that the People have a Faith
in these Witches, being ignorant as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'>What the true God and right Devil is, and the Witches Faith, and
their Faith being joyn'd together, it becometh strong to atchieve
such Apparitions as their Faith hath chose to be the Object of their
Imagination: For he that enquireth of a Witch, his Faith and the
Witch's Faith is all one.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_5'></a>Also this is to be minded, that all Witches have some Rule by
which they do perceive those Apparitions, and hear those Voices;
for their is no wicked Knowledge or wicked Wisdom as the Wisdom
of the World, neither is there any good Knowledge or good Wisdom
as the Wisdom of God. I say, there is no Knowledge or Wisdom
good or bad, but those that have it they must go by some Rule, else
it is meer Nonsense; as most of your <i>Quakers</i> Matters or Principles
are meer Nonsense, that hath neither Bottom nor Top.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. III.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>But to the Matter in hand, we see the natural Astrologers they
go by a Rule, and their Wisdom and Knowledge in Things of
Nature, it is declared by them from and by a Rule, else that they
say would be meer Nonsense and Foolishness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet I say, your natural Astrologers they are Witches, and have their
Figure to judge the Effects of the Stars; but this Witchcraft is allowed
by the Powers of the Nations.</p>

<p class='c004'>So I say, these Witches that doth do Things by a Familiar Spirit,
they have a Rule to walk by as the other hath; for as the Imagination
of the other hath by the Study of the Figure, attained to give
some Judgment upon the Effects of the Stars, upon a particular Person
or Nation. So likewise those Witches that hath a Familiar Spirit,
they have attained to this Familiar Spirit out of their Imagination
of Reason, as I said before.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this Familiar Spirit being begotten in themselves by the
Strength of Imagination their Father; now understand thus much,
that this diabolical Wisdom that is begotten in Man and Woman by
the Imagination of Reason, the Devil is that Familiar Spirit that
Men and Women do act by.</p>

<p class='c004'>And after this Familiar Spirit is begotten in Man or Woman by
Imagination their father, as I said before, then this Familiar Spirit
of the Witch will motion in the Mind too fast, and pray unto the
Host of Heaven, the Sun, Moon and Planets, supposing that the
good Spirit in some of them, and imagining the evil Spirit or Devil
to be in other some of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now observe, when this Familiar Spirit is produced in them, then
they observe every Motion of the Mind, and their Faith being in
every Motion of their Minds, it produceth either some farther Knowledge
<a id='Page_6'></a>in their own Apprehension, or else some Visions are presented
to their Phantasies; for they have dedicated some certain Words to
be said in their Minds motional, to be used when they would do any
Feats, besides their Fasting and Prayer. And this Thing they have
dedicated to enquire of, is that which they divine with, or tell any
Thing from it, is much like unto the Astrologers, their Figure is dedicated
for that Purpose, that he may tell Things from, and without
the Knowledge of the Figure. He can tell nothing except he
were skilled in it before, but the Figure was the Thing he came to
know more than others at the first; for wonderful Things may be
accomplished through the Imagination of Reason, when it hath set
it self apart on purpose to attain unto such Things.</p>

<p class='c004'>For I find by Experience within this seventeen Years, what strange
Things hath been atchieved by Man and Woman, who hath given
themselves up to an unknown God upon a Religious Account. Some
hath by their Fasting and Prayer unto an unknown God, attained
unto Visions, Apparitions, Appearance of Angels, Voices, and many
other strange Things; yet altogether ignorant of the true God and
the right Devil, and what Angels are; so that these Things hath
been all within them, and they thought that God had revealed these
Things unto them; when as they did attain unto these Things aforesaid
by their own Endeavours; as many <i>Quakers</i> and others can Witness
at this Day, if they would, by hearkening to the Light within
them, and Fasting, and such like. Neither did God present any Vision,
or speak any Voice unto them, but they do produce those
Things aforesaid by their own Imaginations.</p>

<p class='c004'>So is it with Witches, they do raise Shapes and Voices out of
themselves, and those Voices they hear, they are no other but motional
Voices in themselves; and the ignorant People that believes
them is Partakers of those motional Voices also with the
Witch.</p>

<p class='c004'>For their is no Spirit of the Devil without them, that doth assume
any Shape, or speak any Voice unto the Witch, neither doth
any Spirit without the Witch reveal any Knowledge unto them;
it is all produced by their own wicked Imagination, who hath begotten
within themselves that Familiar Spirit they deal with, and not
from any Devil or Spirit without them.</p>

<p class='c004'>But all cometh from the Imagination within, that is, the Devil
and no other; yet this Familiar Spirit is produced from within
them, to see Shapes, and hear motional Voices, meerly by watching
the Motion of the Imagination that is placed in their Minds
<a id='Page_7'></a>or Hearts, even as the <i>Quakers</i> do by hearkening to the Light within
them, they do procure many strange Visions and motional
Voices, but they being Groundless and Nonsensical they come to
nothing.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. IV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Let the Reader observe when King <i>Saul</i> asked the Witch of
<i>Endor</i>, <i>What Form the Gods was of, she had seen ascend out of the
Earth</i>; The Woman answered and said, <i>An old Man with a Mantle,
&amp;c.</i> But <i>Saul</i> saw nothing but as the Woman told him, and <i>Saul</i> believed
her Words, and bowed himself to the Ground.&mdash;&mdash;Now
mind the 15th Verse, Samuel <i>said to</i> Saul, <i>why hast thou disquieted me
to bring me up</i>; the Meaning is this, now the Witch had full Power
over <i>Saul</i>, so that he did really believe the Witch, that she had indeed
raised up <i>Samuel</i>, though he saw nothing&mdash;&mdash;yet the Fear of
being destroyed by the <i>Philistines</i>, and the Belief of the Woman's
Words, <i>Samuel</i> began to speak in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience; there came into
<i>Saul</i>'s Mind the Words which <i>Samuel</i> had told him in his Life-time.&mdash;&mdash;So
that these was no speaking to <i>Saul</i> by <i>Samuel</i>, but
the Reasonings of <i>Saul</i>'s own Heart; and these Voices that <i>Samuel</i>
spake to <i>Saul</i>, they were motional Voices that did arise in <i>Saul</i>'s own
Heart.&mdash;&mdash;For an accusing Conscience will speak dreadful Voices
in the Conscience; as the Blood of <i>Abel</i> cried for Vengeance in
<i>Cain</i>'s Conscience, and the Saints that were slain under the Altar;
cried for Vengeance upon those that shed their Blood; so that a
sinful Conscience will have Voices enough to torment him, though
God himself, nor Prophet without him, doth never speak unto him.
A guilty Conscience will speak with a motional Voice their great
Terror and Torment, which is greater than can be born, as it was
with <i>Cain</i>, <i>Saul</i>, and <i>Judas</i>. Yea, it was Fear, and the Remembrance
of <i>Saul</i>'s Disobedience to <i>Samuel</i>'s Words in his Life-time,
this did arise afresh in <i>Saul</i>'s Mind, and spake with motional Voices
in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience, accusing him for his Disobedience to <i>Samuel</i>'s
Words.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the Remembrance of <i>Samuel</i>'s Words, may be said to disquiet
<i>Samuel</i>; for <i>Samuel</i>'s Words were buried in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now, by his going to enquire of a Witch, <i>Samuel</i> is revived
again in <i>Saul</i>'s Mind, and there <i>Samuel</i> speaks Fear, Wrath, and
<a id='Page_8'></a>Terror; for <i>Samuel</i>'s Words spake in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience one motional
Voice, and the Guilt of <i>Saul</i>'s Disobedience spake Fear and Horror
in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience, this was a motional Voice in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience
also; for the Voice of Truth will speak, or the Voice of Obedience,
and the Voice of Sin and Disobedience will speak in Man's Conscience,
as if they were two distinct Spirits.</p>

<p class='c004'>This many guilty Consciences can witness, as we may read by
<i>Cain</i> that killed his Brother, and <i>Judas</i> that betrayed his Lord, and
many others who hath been guilty of the like Crimes.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Witch did raise no <i>Samuel</i>, nor Spirit, but a meer
Shadow it was the Witch saw, which she could raise by her Art;
neither was there any <i>Samuel</i> or Spirit not at all that did speak to
<i>Saul</i>, but that motional Voice in <i>Saul</i>'s Conscience as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in this Sense <i>Samuel</i> may be said to be disquieted; for if <i>Saul</i>
had never gone to the Witch to enquire of her, <i>Samuel</i>'s Words had
been quiet in <i>Saul</i>; neither would <i>Saul</i> have had such Reasonings in
himself, nor have been so sensible of the Worm of his Conscience.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that there was no Voice of <i>Samuel</i> spoke unto <i>Saul</i>, but a motional
Voice in <i>Saul</i>'s own Mind or Conscience; his Fear and his Disobedience,
and what <i>Samuel</i> had told him before, these all speaking
with Voices in his wounded Conscience. <i>Samuel</i>'s Words spake one
Voice, and his own Disobedience spake another; so that the
Witch of <i>Endor</i> did neither raise <i>Samuel</i>, but only made the King
believe she did, neither did <i>Samuel</i> speak to the King but as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the Kingdom being rent out of his Hands, his Sons being destroyed,
and all other Threatnings of <i>Samuel</i>, they came into <i>Saul</i>'s
Mind afresh with strong Motions, so that they became as Voices in
<i>Saul</i>'s Heart, as if <i>Samuel</i> had spake to the hearing of the Ear: For
there was no <i>Samuel</i> raised, nor no <i>Samuel</i> spake, but what was motional
in the Mind of <i>Saul</i>, and what did visionally appear unto the
Witch, which was a meer Shadow which she could produce by her
Witchcraft-Art, to all those that were more ignorant than her self,
or had Faith in her Power.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. V.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>For the Reader must mind, that Witches and all those that
doth attain to the Visions, and hear Voices within them, they
do use Means to attain unto it; also they have some standing Rule
<a id='Page_9'></a>or Art, by which they come to enquire or to know Things, that are
above that Knowledge which is common to other People, it is much
like unto the Ways of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore let the Reader mind the Ground work laid down at
the first, that the Imagination of Reason had begotten a Son out of
the Womb of the Seed of Reason in Man, which I call the Mother,
and Imagination the Father, and the Son that is begotten in the
Womb of Reason; by Imagination the Father is that great Wisdom,
Knowledge and Power, by which they go beyond other People who
are of a lower Capacity.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Son is that Familiar Spirit Witches doth deal with; it is
another Spirit begotten in them, which was not in their Birth,
when they were born, but begotten in themselves since by Imagination
as aforesaid; Neither is this Familiar Spirit produced, or
doth come from any Thing, or any Devil without them, as People
do vainly imagine; but the Familiar Spirit it is produced, and
doth come from within, <i>for out of the Heart cometh evil Thoughts,
Murder, Adultery</i>, &amp;c. And all Familiar Spirits, they are all conceived
in the Heart, and being conceived there, in its Season it
bringeth forth such Spirits as are conceived in the Heart; if Envy
and Murder be conceived, as it was in <i>Cain</i>, then it bringeth
forth the Spirit or Deed of Murder; if Lust be conceived in the
Heart, it bringeth forth the Spirit and Act of Adultery, as it did
in <i>David</i>; and if a Familiar Spirit be conceived in the Heart,
then it bringeth forth such a Spirit that shall speak motional
Voices within them, as if some Spirits without them did appear without
a Body, and speak to them, and reveal those Things unto them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many wicked Spirits more then is mentioned, are conceived in the
Hearts of Men and Women, and acted by them, Spirits, I say,
that were never of God's Creation, but hath been conceived
in the Mind of Man since; for when Sin is conceived, as in
<i>James</i> i. 15. <i>When Lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin; and Sin
when it is finished, bringeth forth Death</i>: so that there is a Conception
of Sin first in the Heart; and if it doth not die before it quickens
into Life, that is, into act; then it bringeth forth Death, which is
the Punishment due to such Sins, that are alive in Man's Actions, after
they were conceived in the Heart. And as the Evil of Murder,
Adultery, and Theft is conceived first in the Heart, so is that Familiar
Spirit Witches and Wizards have; they are first conceived in
the Mind, and in a little Season it groweth alive in them, and
speaketh unto them, as if it were without them: For this I say,
<a id='Page_10'></a>that a Familiar Spirit is conceived and begotten in the Heart of
Man and Woman, as the other Sins aforementioned are, and the
Cause why God is more angry with those that deal with a Familiar
Spirit, and hath commanded them to be put to Death, more than
for other Sins conceived in the Mind is, because they imitate the
Way of God. Or the Spirit of Prophecy, which causeth the People
to believe in a meer Fiction or Shadow without any Substance,
that a Spirit may be raised out of the Ground without a Body, and
so they forsake the living God, who hath a Body of his own, and
gave Life to every Creature, that hath a Body and doth believe a
Lie, which hath been conceived in the Mind, and hath quickned into
a Familiar Spirit, and this Spirit doth always live within the Witch,
and not without her; and this Familiar Spirit thus conceived, first
in the evil Mind, and afterward quickning in the evil Heart, <i>it goeth
from Strength to Strength, and from one Degree of Knowledge, to a farther
Degree of</i> evil <i>Knowledge, and evil Wisdom</i>, as all Things else
doth that hath Life; for Sin hath Life in it, and the outward Law
causeth Sin to revive in every one that doth evil, as St. <i>Paul</i> saith,
<i>Rom.</i> vii. 9. Thus in some Measure the Reader may understand
what a Familiar Spirit is, and how it comes to have a Being in
Witches and Wizards, and how the ignorant are Partakers with
the Familiar Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the next Place, I shall shew how those that have a Familiar
Spirit do imitate the way of God, or the way of true Prophets; observe
the Way and Manner of true Prophets, High-Priests, and all other
People, who are richly gifted with the Spirit of Prophecy, or
Revelation; for the Seed of Faith planted in the Heart, is the Seed
and Nature of God, as Reason is the Seed and Nature of the Serpent
or Devil; and as the Seed of Reason is the Womb or Mother for
Imagination to get a Son.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise the Seed of Faith in Man, is the Womb or Mother for
the Revelation of Faith, to beget a Son out of the Seed of Faith,
answerable as the Imagination doth out of the Seed of Reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this Son the Revelation hath begotten out of the Seed of
Faith, is that heavenly Wisdom, discerning Knowledge and Power
over the Spirits of others, and Knowledge of Things above the
Stars, and knoweth the true God in Form and Nature, with many
other heavenly Secrets, which none else can know but those that
believe them.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Revelation of Faith hath begotten this heavenly Wisdom,
Power and Glory out of the Seed of Faith, which is the Seed
<a id='Page_11'></a>of God, even of his Divine Nature; and this Wisdom, Power, and
Glory, is that Son or Spirit, by which all Prophets, High Priests,
Apostles and others that have it.</p>

<p class='c004'>I say this is that by which they can truly divine by, in that they
can foretel truly what shall come to pass, according to the Knowledge
of the Revelation of Faith; and this Wisdom, and Knowledge
being produced by Revelation out of the Womb of the Seed of Faith,
it may and is called the Spirit of God in Man, that doth teach and
shew the Wisdom of God to others, so that others cometh to be
taught and subjected by it, to their great Peace here, and eternal
Joy hereafter.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. VI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>And this Spirit of Wisdom, Knowledge and Power, which
is produced by the Revelation as aforesaid, it hath motional
Voices in the Conscience, as the Familiar Spirit hath in the evil Conscience;
but the motional Voices in a good Conscience speaketh
Peace. Likewise this motional Voice in Prophets, High-Priests,
Apostles, and others, is that by which they do foretel Things by,
whether it be good or bad, that shall befal those that shall
enquire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also the Spirit of Revelation hath a standing Rule to enquire by,
as those have that doth tell Things by a Familiar Spirit, as I said before;
for the Witches doth imitate the way of the Prophets, and
the Devil's Way is as like God's Way as he can.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now let the Reader mind, and he may see how Men have enquired
of the Lord by motional Voices in the Mind, by that Spirit of
Faith which is gotten by Revelation, which is called the Spirit of
God.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the Time of the Law of <i>Moses</i>, the Ephod was a standing
Rule, for to enquire of God for good or bad Success. Now there
was no Man could tell what the Event would be that looked upon
the Ephod, but such Men as had the Spirit of Revelation and Prophecy
in them; as <i>David</i> and the High Priest, as soon as ever they
looked upon the Ephod, they could tell whether they should prosper
in Battle or not; but if any other Man which had not the Spirit
of Revelation and Prophecy should look upon the Ephod, they could
tell nothing by it.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_12'></a>Though the Ephod was appointed of God, on purpose to enquire
of God, yet none could find out God's Mind, but such Men aforesaid;
for as soon as ever <i>David</i> or the High-Priest looked upon the Ephod,
they could tell what the Event would be, as may be seen, 1 <i>Sam.</i> xxiii.
6, 9. how <i>David</i> called for the Ephod and <i>Abiathar</i> the Priest to
bring it to enquire of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet God never spake to them by Voice, yet they had motional
Voices in themselves in their Hearts, assuring them that they prosper
or not prosper; yet God never appeared himself, nor any Angel,
neither did God speak by any Voice, yet they are bid to go and prosper,
as if they had heard some Voice by looking upon the Ephod,
so that those Voices that bid them go and prosper, they were motional
Voices that did arise from the Revelation and Spirit of Prophecy
within them by that Skill they had in the Ephod, which was
appointed of God for that Purpose. So that all <i>David</i>'s Voices, and
the High-Priest Voices, that were motional Voices, yet called the
Voice of God, because they did arise from the Seed of Faith in <i>David</i>
and others, which is the Divine Nature of God, therefore called
the Spirit of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this I say, if <i>Saul</i> had not lost that Spirit of Prophecy by his
Disobedience, as he once had, when the good Spirit departed from
him, he might have enquired of the Ephod, and have been answered
with a motional Voice by the Ephod, as he was by enquiring of a
Witch.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the Spirit of <i>Samuel</i> did speak no more to <i>Saul</i>, then the Spirit
of God did speak to <i>David</i>, they were both motional Voices that did
arise from their two Seeds the one Voice spake Peace and Deliverance,
and the other spake Wrath and Destruction; the one did enquire in
the Way that God did appoint, even of the Ephod, or of the Lord's
Prophets; the other did enquire of that which was forbidden, and
forsook the Lord and his Prophets, and went to a Witch to enquire:
It was because one was the Seed of <i>Adam</i>, which is the Seed of God,
and so chosen of God in Mercy, even <i>David</i>; and the other was the
Seed of the Serpent, even the Devil, who was chosen King in God's
Wrath even <i>Saul</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is the true Interpretation of those Voices that <i>Samuel</i> spake to
<i>Saul</i>, and of his being raised by the Witch of <i>Endor</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore you that can understand these things as aforementioned,
you may see how the whole World lieth in Darkness, and are cheated
of their Sense and Reason by this lying and vain Imagination, to
believe that Spirits can be without Bodies, or that Spirits can be raised
<a id='Page_13'></a>without Bodies, or that Spirits can speak without Bodies, or that
Spirits departed can assume any Shapes afterwards; these Things and
many more are produced by the dark Imagination of the Heart of
Man: And if the Reader hath any true Light of Faith in him, he may
understand the Interpretation I have given of the Witch of <i>Endor</i>,
and how a Familiar Spirit is produced or begotten in them, and be
satisfied in his Mind as to that Matter; so much concerning those
Words in <i>Samuel</i> aforementioned.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. VII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Again, it is said, <i>Isa.</i> viii. 29. the Prophet speaking there to
unbelieving <i>Israelites</i> that did not believe the Word of the Lord
through the Prophets Mouths, concerning the Destruction that should
come upon <i>Israel</i>; this Judgment did the Lord threaten by the
Mouth of his Prophet <i>Isaiah</i> to bring upon <i>Israel</i> for their Unbelief;
and this Prophet seeing the People would not hearken unto the Voice
of the Lord's Prophets, nor inquire of them, but altogether persecuted
them as false Prophets, Deceivers and Liers, and the Inclination
of their Hearts was more willing and desirous to enquire of
a Witch or Wizard, who had a Familiar Spirit then of the Prophet
of the Lord, as you may see Chapter and Verse above-written; the
Words are these as followeth.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>And when they shall say unto you, seek unto them that have Familiar
Spirits, and unto Wizards that peep and that mutter, should not a People
seek unto their God for the living to the dead.</i> The Meaning of
these Words is this, that unbelieving Men do think and believe
that Witches and Wizards who hath a Familiar Spirit, can rise out
of the Ground where dead Men were buried, living Spirits without
Bodies that can reveal Things unto them, by that motional
Voice that doth proceed from these Familiar Spirits, which doth peep
and mutter.</p>

<p class='c004'>That is, the Whisperings that proceeds from this Familiar Spirit,
that is begotten by the Imagination of Reason the Father, and the
Seed of Reason the Mother, as I said before, is that motional Voice all
Witches and Wizards have, whereby they peep and mutter in themselves,
as if they did hear Voices and see Shapes, and living Spirits
arise out of the Ground, as the Witch of <i>Endor</i> said to King <i>Saul</i>,
<i>She saw Gods ascend out of the earth</i>. When as there was no Spirit nor
<a id='Page_14'></a>Shape came out of the Ground, at all; but the Gods she saw ascend
out of the Earth came out of her own Imagination, even that Familiar
Spirit begotten in her, it seemed unto her as if it did ascend out of the
Earth, but those Gods she said she saw ascend out of the Earth, they
ascended out of her own Imagination, and <i>Saul</i> believed her, and so
was Partakers with her, and he did believe that she had raised <i>Samuel</i>'s
Spirit out of the Earth, as the Witch had said.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this is to be minded by the Reader, that when Spirits are to
be raised by Witches, her Familiar Spirit always ariseth out of her
own self, even from the Seed of Reason and Imagination of her own
Heart, whereby she doth hear Voices within her, whispering low
Voices, as if some other Spirits without her did spake with a low
Voice unto her, and present Shapes unto her dazled Eyes, which
seemeth to the Witch to be real Voices of a Spirit without her, and
a real Shape without her; when as in Deed and in Truth, it ariseth
out of her own self, even from the Seed of Reason, and Imagination
of her own Heart, whereby she doth hear Voices within her, whispering
low Voices, as if some other Spirit without her did speak with
a low Voice to her, and present Shapes to her dazled Eyes, which
seemeth to the Witch to be a real Voice of a Spirit without her, and
a real Shape without her, when as in Deed and in Truth it is nothing
else but a motional Voice begotten in her self, and Shapes begotten
in her self, by the Imagination in the Womb of Reason as
aforesaid, which is that Familiar Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Which is that Familiar Spirit she doth deal with, she thinking it
is from some Spirit without her, she not knowing it is begotten in
her; and this Familiar Spirit begotten in her, it whispers within her
with a low motional Voice, as if some Spirit did whisper out of the
Ground. According to that saying of the Prophet, <i>Isa.</i> xxix. 4. concerning
the Destruction or Judgment of God upon <i>Jerusalem</i>; the
Words are these, <i>And thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of
the Ground, and thy Speech shall be low out of the Dust, and thy Voice shall
be as one that hath a Familiar Spirit out of the Ground, and thy Speech shall
whisper out of the Dust</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>As if the Prophet should say, Seeing you have refused to hearken
to the Voice of the Prophets, which hath declared the Mind of the
God of <i>Israel</i> openly with a loud Voice; you have heard them speak
plain Words with your Ears, but you have not believed they spoke
Truth unto you; therefore you have rejected the Word of the Lord
by his Prophets, and have persecuted and slain some of them as false
<a id='Page_15'></a>Prophets, because they spake unto you in the Name of the Lord, as
it was revealed by the Spirit of Revelation in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>They spake plain Words unto you, as might be heard to the outward
Ear by the Standers-by; they were visible Men that spake unto
you, so that you need not to enquire after any that hath a Familiar
Spirit, who speaketh so softly and so low, that no Standers-by can
hear this Familiar Spirit speak, but he or she that hath it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But as for plain Words openly declared by the Prophets, and
publickly heard by the outward Ear, these you have rejected, despised,
persecuted, and counted them Liars, Deceivers, false Prophets,
and such like: Therefore God hath given you over to strong
Delusions, to enquire of a Witch, who makes you believe that Spirits
may be raised out of the Ground, and that Spirits do come out
of the Dust, and whisper to the Witch with a low Voice, that none
can hear but her self. So that those that enquire do believe as King
<i>Saul</i> did, that a Familiar Spirit can enter into the Dust or Ground,
and bring up another Man's Spirit that is dead without its Body,
and so their two Spirits whisper so low together, that none can hear
that stands by, nor tell what this Spirit that is raised did say, nor
whether the Spirit so raised is gone into the Body again, or into the
Ground from whence the Witch said it was raised; which Spirit
that is said to be raised, or said to speak out of the Ground, I say, it
was raised out of the Witches own Body, and no where else; and
those low Voices and Whisperings were both within her, and not
without her.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. VIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Now how a Man may be said to be brought down, and shall
speak out of the Ground, and their Speech shall be low out
of the Dust: The Meaning is, when a particular Man or Woman,
or a People or Nation, be in the same Distress and Condition as
King <i>Saul</i> was; that is, in Danger of loosing his Crown and Kingdom,
his natural Life; and not only so, but his Soul is tormented
with the Fear of eternal Death; this maketh the Heart of Man to
melt in him; it makes his Speech to grow weak and feeble, so that
his Speech can hardly be heard; it is even as if a Man did speak out
of Death, or out of the Ground.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_16'></a>A Man with the Extremity of outward and inward Trouble, he
becomes Speechless, yet he speaks in his Thoughts, but so low, that
none that stands by can hear or tell what he saith. This many can
experience, that have seen their Friend or Relation in this Condition;
this is like speaking out of the Ground, and low out of the
Dust. And the Voice of every such troubled Soul, who hath the
Plagues of this Life, and the Horror of Conscience as to the Life to
come, as King <i>Saul</i> had the Voice such People have, is as one that
hath a Familiar Spirit out of the Ground, and their Speech shall be
as if one did whisper out of the Dust.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Place of Scripture hath the same Meaning as the Place before-mentioned,
<i>Isa.</i> viii. 19. where such as King <i>Saul</i> was, are bade
to seek unto them that have Familiar Spirits, and unto Wizards, that
peep and mutter, (that is) that whisper out of the Ground; for
whisper, peep, and mutter, signifies all one Thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>These Things did <i>Manasseh</i>, 2 <i>Kings</i> xxi. 6. he dealt with Familiar
Spirits, and did great Abominations; he made his Sons to pass
thorough the Fire, in offering them up a Sacrifice to an unknown
Devil, which he thought was God; and this he did by the Whisperings
of the Familiar Spirit within him, and being acquainted
with others, who were known to have Familiar Spirits also. And
so did several other Kings of <i>Israel</i> deal with Familiar Spirits, and
had those low whispering Voices in themselves, as if Spirits had
risen out of the Ground, or from the Dust to speak unto them; and
this they did attain unto by Industry, in that they forsook the Words
of the Prophets, and would not hearken unto them, but gave themselves
up to follow the Imaginations of their own Hearts; imagining
they might as well know God, and what Worship would please God
as well as the Prophets; therefore why should we, being Kings,
hearken unto such mean inferiour Men as these? May not we by our
Familiar Spirit as well know God, and what Worship will please
him by our Familiar Spirit, as the Prophets do by the Spirit of Prophecy?
Why should we be in such Bondage, that we can do nothing
but what they say, the Lord commands us to do? So the Imagination
saith, Come, we will not be tied up thus; we will see
what our Familiar Spirit begotten in us will do; we will erect and
build Altars in several Places, and sacrifice Bullocks and Lambs to an
unknown God; and so by this Means they procure in themselves low
motional Voices, which whisper in themselves, which becomes in
them a Familiar Spirit, is produced in themselves: And there is a more
Increase of low motional Voices, which doth whisper in the Mind,
<a id='Page_17'></a>moving them to a further Degree of Knowledge, and endeavour after
more Voices, so that to attain to this diabolical Wisdom in a more
high Measure. They are moved by this low Voice within them to
offer up their own Children in Sacrifices to their imaginary God, which
they believe is an invisible Spirit without a Body, which reveals these
Things unto them, and whispers and speaks those Voices unto them.</p>

<p class='c004'>They count nothing too dear for this their imaginary God,
no not their own Sons and Daughters, as <i>Manasseh</i> and others
did, that made their Sons and Daughters pass through the Fire as a
Sacrifice to their imaginary God, that had spoke so many Voices to
them, and had whispered to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>But all these Whisperings and low Voices, and peeping of Spirits
out of the Ground, as they thought, I say, they were all within them;
for when they came in any Trouble, their Familiar Spirit departs
from them, and will not comfort them any more, let it be either in
Poor or Rich, nay, Kings that have dealt with Familiar Spirits, when
they have been in Trouble, all their comfort hath been lost, as the
poorest Witch that is, as may be seen by <i>Manasseh</i> and other King
spoken of in the Scripture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now observe, when God doth bring upon a People, Nation, or
particular Person, some great Judgment and Destruction, let it be
either outward or inward in the Mind, when it comes upon a People,
Nation, or particular Person, for their Sins and Wickedness they
have committed, in forsaking the Lord's Prophets, and dealing with
Witches and Familiar Spirits; as <i>Saul</i> forsook the Lord and went to
a Witch, and <i>Manasseh</i>, and several other Kings of <i>Israel</i>, who ought
only to have obeyed the Prophets of the Lord; but they forsook
him, and enquired of Witches and Wizards, and dealt with Familiar
Spirits themselves, and caused the People to worship the Devil
(whom they imagined to be God) instead of the true God, whom
the Prophets would have had them to worship.</p>

<p class='c004'>But when this Punishment for Sin is inflicted upon a People, Nation,
or particular Person, for dealing with Familiar Spirits, and
worshipping of Devils; when Punishment comes, it makes the Heart
or Hearts to fail, for the Spirit is brought down by this Judgment
even to Death, and so goeth to the Ground; so that the very Fear,
Trouble, and Sorrow of Heart, shall speak as it were out of the Dust,
or out of Death; for Sin will speak out of the Ground, and the Speech
of Death will be low in them that have escaped the Destruction
which others did go through; for there will be a Resemblance in
those that have escaped, how their Friends and Relations are fallen
<a id='Page_18'></a>to the Ground or Dust of the Earth for their Wickedness, so that
Sorrow and Grief will speak in the Mind of those that have escaped
with a low Speech, even as one doth who hath a Familiar Spirit.
Or as if their Friends and Relations, the Remembrance of their Destruction
being taken away in Wrath for Sin, it speaks a small low
Voice of Grief and Sorrow in the Heart of those that are alive, even
as one that hath a Familiar Spirit, even a low motional Voice of Sorrow
and Grief, and it cometh as it were out of the Ground, or out
of the Dust.</p>

<p class='c004'>That is the very Influence of Grief and Sorrow, for their dead
Friends and People; it causeth, where Grief is, to hear as it were low
Voices and small Speeches, even out of the Ground or out of the Dust
of the Earth: Just as it was with <i>Cain</i> in another Case, the Lord
said to <i>Cain</i>, <i>Thy Brother's Blood crieth from the Ground for Vengeance</i>;
and so the Blood of those that were slain under the Altar did <i>from the
Ground cry for Vengeance</i>, as in <i>Rev.</i> vi. 10. it crieth for Vengeance in
the Consciences of all bloody Persecutors. So in like Manner doth
the Death and Destruction of a People, who are destroyed for wicked
Idolatry, as those were the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i> speaketh of, they spake
from the Ground a low Speech in the Conscience of those that were
concerned, Grief, Sorrow, and Fear of the same Punishment, and
such like.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. IX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>For where Grief and Sorrow is rooted and settled in the Heart,
it speaketh with low motional Voices in the Mind; that is, the
thought of Fear in the Mind, both of temporal Losses and the Loss
of eternal Peace. The Fear moves to and fro in that Mind, as if it
were a Speech out of the Ground; for the Thoughts of the Heart
are low Voices which cannot be heard by any but themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>So is it with those that have a Familiar Spirit, their Voices and
Speech they hear from Spirits without them, as if Spirits did speak
to them out of the Ground: Which Speech they say they hear, is
nothing else but the Thoughts that pass to and fro in their own
Minds, a low motional Voice in themselves, as if Spirits did speak
to them with a low Voice out of the Ground, or out of the Dust.
For their Faith is strong, and above all those that come to enquire
of a Witch, they do all believe that Spirits may be raised without
<a id='Page_19'></a>Bodies out of the Ground, as the Witch doth; so they both do believe,
that the Spirit came out of the Ground that spake those low
Voices to the Witch, and she tells it to the other that enquire of her,
and they believe her as King <i>Saul</i> did.</p>

<p class='c004'>So they are wholly departed from the Lord, and believe a Lye, to
think that Spirits can be raised out of the Ground without Bodies
after Men have been dead; it is a Thing God never did; we never
read in Scripture, that God or his Prophets did ever raise any Spirits
out of the Ground without Bodies after they were dead; but we read
in Scripture, that God and his Prophets have raised some from the
dead with Bodies, as that of <i>Lazarus</i> being raised out of the Ground
by Christ, and the Child that was raised from Death by the Prophet
<i>Elijah</i>, and another Child raised from Death to Life by the Prophet
<i>Elisha</i>, and several others come forth out of the Ground at the rising
again of Christ from Death, as those Saints that did arise out of the
Graves, and appeared to many that were alive; these all did arise
out of the Graves with Bodies after they were dead, and <i>Lazarus</i>
came forth out of the Ground after he was dead, but his Spirit came
not out of the Ground without his Body, but Body and Soul came
out of the Ground together.</p>

<p class='c004'>For it was always God's Practice to raise Soul and Body together;
and because the Imagination of Reason in those that have a Familiar
Spirit cannot do so, nor those that enquire of them, therefore they do
imagine that Spirit may be raised out of the Ground without Bodies, or
assume a Shape and appear like a Body, yet it shall be of no Substance,
a Shape that can neither be felt nor handled by the Hand of Man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now mind, all those God doth raise out of the Ground after they
were dead, they may be handled and felt, though they be Spiritual
Bodies, yet they may be felt and handled, as Christ said to <i>Thomas</i>,
<i>Feel me and handle me</i>, after he was risen from the dead, and <i>Thomas
laid his Fingers in the Print of the Nails, and on his Side</i>. Yet Christ
was at that time a Spiritual Body that was risen from the Dead, that
might be felt and handled, and not a Spirit without a Body, as most
People do vainly imagine that Spirits may be raised without Bodies.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as for that <i>Lazarus</i> and others, that were raised by the Power
of God out of the Ground after they had been dead, they had Bodies
as well as Spirits that might be seen with natural Eyes, and handled
and felt with natural Hands. So that God's Power in raising the
Dead, it is no Cheat; the Creature is not cheated nor deceived, but
is fully satisfied in his Mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>But for a Familiar Spirit to say or tell People, they do or can raise
<a id='Page_20'></a>Spirits out of the Ground in such a Shape without a Body or bodily
Substance; or shall say, they hear Voices from this Spirit so raised,
is a mere Cheat to the Ignorant and Unbelieving, and leads them into
the Pit of Darkness, and makes them fear where no Fear is, and are
afraid of their own Shadows; for it is the Nature of Reason the Devil
to imagine, that this way of raising of Spirits without Bodies, to
be of a more high Nature then to raise Spirit and Body together,
as God doth; and the Imagination doth conceive it a more greater
Power, to raise Spirits without Bodies out of the Dust of the
Ground, than it is to raise Spirit and Body together, as Christ did;
for Christ always raised Spirit and Body together, as the Scriptures
do testify.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the Reason in Man doth send forth the Imagination of the
Heart, the unclean Spirit in Man walking through dry Places, seeking
rest but can find none; the ignorant dark Thoughts of the Imagination
goeth out of a Man, to enquire of one that hath a Familiar
Spirit, seeking rest but can find none, as King <i>Saul</i> did: For
the Imagination of the Heart being continually Evil, it always
walketh through dry Places, where no matter of Life is to be had,
to quench the Thirst of Sin or a defiled Conscience; neither can the
Thoughts of Imagination be satisfied with what a Witch or a Familiar
saith; therefore called dry Places: They may be called dry, because
the Heart is never satisfied with what a Witch saith, for she
always saith a Lie.</p>

<p class='c004'>To tell a Man or Woman, that she doth or can raise Spirits out of
the Ground without Bodies, as the Witch of <i>Endor</i> did to King Saul,
or that she did hear any low Voice or Speech of <i>Samuel</i> out of the
Ground, as she told the King; I say, she did but cheat the King,
and made him believe she had raised <i>Samuel</i>, and had heard him
speak to her with a low Speech out of the Ground, which had revealed
unto her what sad Things would befal the King: so he believing
her Words, his Spirit fainted, so that no Strength was in him; when
as in Deed and in Truth, that <i>Samuel</i> she said she saw arise out of the
Earth, he did arise out of her own Heart; and that low Speech she
said <i>Samuel</i> spake, it was all in her self by the Motions of the Familiar
Spirit begotten in her. And King <i>Saul</i> believing her, being Partaker
of her Faith, <i>Samuel</i> spake a low motional Voice or Speech in him
also, he believing it was <i>Samuel</i> spake out of the Earth, but it was
nothing else but the Voice of his own guilty Conscience within himself,
as it was the Voice her Familiar Spirit in her self that spake as
aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_21'></a>So that the Meaning of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, Chap. xxix. 4. concerning
the Destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>, that <i>Grief and Sorrow of Heart should speak
in themselves</i>; as if the Speech came put of the Ground, because they
saw in themselves nothing but Death and Destruction did approach,
and was like to follow upon them all, fearing they should all be destroyed
by their Enemies, and slain and fall to the Ground: So that
Fear of Heart of Destruction, it spake a low Speech in every Man's
Heart, even as if it spake out of the Ground, or as one that hath a
Familiar Spirit; for it is the Nature of a Familiar Spirit to speak as
if the Speech did proceed from the Earth, and the Speech doth seem
to the Witch, and those that enquire of her, to whisper out of the
Dust: When as the Speech cometh not out of the Ground, neither
doth it whisper out of the Dust, as is imagined by most People, because
Ignorance and Darkness hath overspread the Minds of most
People in the World. But that low Speech the Familiar Spirit speaks
or whispers, it is out of her own Heart, even that Wisdom begotten
by the Imagination in her own Thoughts, that speaks as aforesaid,
and no Spirit without her, as hath vainly been imagined.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise the People of the <i>Jews</i>, the Fear, Grief, and Sorrow
of Heart, being begotten in them for such like Sins, as that of Witchcraft,
Idolatry, dealing with Familiar Spirits, causing their Sons and
Daughters to pass through the Fire as burnt Offerings and Sacrifices
unto Devils, which they supposed to be Gods; these Things caused
their Hearts to fail and faint, and their Thoughts were troubled
within themselves, which causeth their Speech to grow weak and
low within them, even as if some Familiar did speak out of the
Ground, or whisper out of the Dust, Fear, Grief, and Sorrow of
Heart: But all come out of their own grieved Hearts, who were
punished for their Sins; and not out of the natural Ground or natural
Dust, as People do vainly imagine. This is the true Meaning of the
Prophet's Words, and how Familiar Spirits may be said to speak out
of the Ground, and whisper out of the Dust.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. X.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Again, it hath been objected by many, that Spirits may be
raised without Bodies, and that Spirits may be talked with
after they have been dead and buried; and that Spirits have appeared
in a Shape to several People, yet this Spirit so appearing hath no Body
<a id='Page_22'></a>nor Substance at all, neither can it be felt or handled by mortal Man,
nor no immortal Creature neither: this is the vain Conceit of most
People.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to satisfy the Reader in this, I declare, that there is no immortal
Spirit whatsoever, but it hath a Spiritual Body suitable to
its Spirit; if the Spirit be immortal, the Body is immortal also: For
this I say, no Spirit can have any Being at all without a Body, no
not God himself, who was from Eternity; his Spirit could not be
from Eternity without a Spiritual Body, in Form like Man; they
were both from Eternity, and the one was never divided nor separated
from the other, but they were both Eternal. And further I declare,
that God was a Spiritual Body from Eternity, in Form like a
Man; therefore God created Man in his own Image and Likeness.
Now observe, if Man hath a Body suitable to his Spirit, so hath God
a Body suitable to his Spirit, else Man was not created in his Image,
if God hath never a Body, but is all Spirit, as People do vainly imagine.
For this I know, that God was Spirit and Body, in Form like
a Man, from Eternity, and his Spirit was never divided nor separated
from his Body, but they were both Eternal.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise is it with Angels and Men, and all other Creatures;
where-ever the Spirit of Life is, there is Bodies of Life also; let it be
either in Spiritual Bodies, or in Natural Bodies. For if the Body
of either of these be dead, the Spirit is dead also; and if the Spirit
be dead either in Spiritual Body or Natural Body, the Body is dead
also: For the one cannot have any sensible Being without the other.
And further I say, that they were both together Spirit and Body
from Eternity in God the Creator, and he hath ordered and created
all his Creatures, both celestial and terrestrial, that Spirit and Body
should be one living Being, and that one should not subsist nor have
no sensible being without the other: Even as God himself could not
enjoy no sensible Living being without a Body, he knowing this in
himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore he created all his Creatures Spiritual and Natural, with
Bodies suitable to their Spirits, and Spirits suitable to their Bodies, so
that one might not be divided nor separated from the other; for if
one dieth, the other dieth; and if the Spirit live, the Body liveth
also. For this I say, that if the Spirit of God himself could not be
without a Body from Eternity, how then is it possible that his Creatures
should have Spirits without Bodies, seeing he himself his Spirit
could not have any Being without his Body from Eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>But this Conceit, that the Spirit or Soul of Man is immortal, and
<a id='Page_23'></a>cannot die, and may have a Being without a Body, and appear in
a Shape without any Substance; this vain Conceit proceeded first
from the Imagination of Reason in Man, even from <i>Cain</i>, the first
Devil in Flesh and Bone. And this Imagination in <i>Cain</i> his Posterity,
being Heathen Men, who had no Communion with God, nor Revelation
of Faith, as the Sons of <i>Adam</i> and the Sons, of <i>Seth</i>, the Generation
of the Righteous, had; they knew that the Spirit and Body
was all one Substance.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Imagination of Reason, <i>Cain</i> his Posterity, the Heathen
Opinion, do imagine the Spirit of Man to be immortal, and cannot
die; and that Spirits may appear in Shapes without Bodies; and
that Spirits may go out of the Body, and go to Heaven or Hell and
leave the Body to be laid in the Ground, as the Quakers and others do.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this Imagination of Reason in Man hath created to it self a
new Creation, which God never created. Man hath created and
made in his Imagination a Spirit without a Body, and that this Spirit
so created is immortal, and cannot die, nor is not capable of Death,
that it can slip out of the Body, and that it can have a Being when
it is gone out of the Body, and appear in a Shape without Substance
or hath Power to assume what Shape it please, and yet this Shape,
it doth assume, shall have no Substance yet it shall appear in a
Shape and fright People.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the Imagination of Reason in Man hath created Man in his
own Image and Likeness, as God did <i>Adam</i>: As thus, First, he hath
conceived in his Imagination, that God is a Spirit without a Body.
Secondly, he conceiveth in his Imagination that the Devil is a Spirit
flying in the Air, which can neither be seen nor felt; yet this Devil
or Spirit without a Body doth tempt Man to Evil, whereby Man is
punished, and the Tempter he is escaped away without Punishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also it is conceived by the Imagination, that this Devil or Spirit
is in Hell-fire, and in Chains of Darkness, and can go no further then
God will permit him, because his Chain is no longer then God
hath limited him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also it is conceived in the Imagination, notwithstanding the
Devil is chained, and in Hell-fire tormented, yet he being a Spirit
without a Body, he is so swift that he can be in all Places at one
Time, so that he can tempt thousands of Men and Women to sin
at one and the same Time, and they themselves never the wiser, nor
know him when he tempted them. All this the imaginary Devil
can do, and much more; and yet be in Hell fire, and tied in
a Chain at the same Time, and all but one Devil, a Spirit without a
Body.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_24'></a>Also the Imagination hath conceived that the Soul of Man is a
Spirit infused or put into the Body by God himself, and that Man
begets the Body, but not the Soul or Life of Man, that is conceived
to be immortal, or a Spirit that is so invisible, that cannot be seen
nor known what it is, and that it can live of it self when it is gone
out of the Body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus the Imagination of Reason the Devil, hath created its own
Soul in its own Image and Likeness; and this hath been the Occasion
of producing of Familiar Spirits, and of dealing with those that
have a Familiar Spirit, being conformed to the very Image of the
Devil. Many Things more of the like Nature might be said in this
Point.</p>

<p class='c004'>But here the Reader may see if there be any true Light of Faith in
him, how the Imagination of Reason in Man hath created Spirits
without Bodies, and that the Devil is a Body-less Spirit, and in Hell-fire,
and in a Chain of Darkness, and yet at Liberty at the same time
to tempt People; and in Hell-fire, and yet out of the Fire when he
pleaseth; and that he may be called out of Hell, or out of the Ground,
when a Witch by her Familiar Spirit doth call; and that he shall
appear in any Shape they will have him, yet he shall have no Body
nor Substance, but a mere Shadow; yet this Shadow shall speak with
a low Voice or Speech out of the Ground; as if Speech could proceed
from a Shadow without Substance.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Imagination of the Heart of Man hath created to it
self a Devil, that God never created; and the Imagination of Man's
Heart hath created his own Soul in the Image and Likeness of the
Devil, that is to say, a Spirit without a Body; and that a Spirit
without a Body may be capable of Joy or Sorrow; and that a Spirit
may subsist and have a being in Joy or Sorrow without a Body,
which Thing is impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>But observe the Creation that the Imagination of Man hath created
to himself; for it is the Nature of Imagination of Reason the Devil,
he always creates Spirits without Bodies, but God the Creator he
always creates Spirits and Bodies together, for God never created any
Spirit without a Body; for when God made Man after his own Image
and Likeness, he made him with a Body as well as a Spirit, else Man
could not be made in the Image and Likeness of God, if God had a
Body of his own as well as a Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that <i>Adam</i> was made or created in the Image and Likeness of
God; for <i>Adam</i> had a visible Body and Spirit, undivided and unseparable
one from the other; they were but one visible sensible Being,
<a id='Page_25'></a>and when the Life was dead the Body was dead, and when the
Body is really dead, the Spirit and Life was and is dead also; and
both are laid in the Ground together, as is declared in all our
Writings, but more especially in that Book entituled, <i>The Mortality
of the Soul</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Also I do further declare, that God did never create any Spirit
without a Body, neither of Angels, nor Men, nor no other
Creature, neither in Heaven above, nor in the Earth beneath, nor
the Waters under the Earth. There is no Spirit or Life whatsoever
that is created of God, but it hath a Body to that Life or Spirit; but
if a Spirit have any Being without a Body, that Spirit is none of
God's Creation; for God never created any Spirit  whatsoever without
a Body, as I said before.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Imagination of Reason in Man, which is the Devil, hath
created all Creatures in the Imagination to have Spirits without Bodies,
both of Angels above and Man here on Earth, and all Creatures upon
the Earth, and in the Waters, that have the Breath of Life,
the Imagination of Reason saith, their Spirits may subsist without
Bodies, or go out of those Bodies they have, and enter into other
Bodies, and appear in the Shape of a Body, and yet be of no Substance:
so that the Devil's Creation is all of Spirits without Bodies,
and God's Creation is all with Bodies and Spirits together.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this Darkness hath overspread the Nature of Man all the
World over, which is the Occasion of that Opinion of Houses and
Places being haunted with evil Spirits, and Spirits walking without
Bodies, and dealing with Familiar Spirits, that peep, and mutter,
and whisper as it were out of the Ground. These Things and many
more are produced by the Imagination of the Heart of Man, for the
Imagination of Man's Heart is evil, and continually evil; for it hath
given a Being to Spirits without Bodies, to fright it self to that
which hath no Being of it self.</p>

<p class='c004'>For I declare and perfectly know, that there is no such Thing as
Spirits to walk without Bodies, nor assume any Shape after Death,
nor be raised out of the Ground by any Witch or any Familiar Spirit
whatsoever; it is all produced out of the dark Imagination of the
Heart, where Ignorance beareth Rule, for there is no such Thing
<a id='Page_26'></a>can be presented but to the Ignorant and dark minded People.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus I have given the Reader to understand something more concerning
the Power of Witches, and how they may be said to raise
Spirits out of the Ground, and from whence that low Speech doth
come, with those Scriptures opened that speak as if a Familiar Spirit
did hear whispering out of the Dust.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also I have given the Interpretation of that in <i>Samuel</i> concerning
the Witch of <i>Endor</i>, and those Places of Scripture in <i>Isaiah</i>; these
Places are the most concerning Spirits being raised without Bodies,
of any in the Scriptures; but there have been some other Places of
Scriptures, that do seem to carry a shew as if Spirits might rise again
without Bodies, and I have been desired by some to open those
Scriptures that seem to tend to that Purpose, though the common
and general Objection amongst all People is, that of the Witch of
<i>Endor</i> and King <i>Saul</i>, which I have opened before; yet for the further
Satisfaction of the Reader, I shall open and interprete the other
Places objected, that seem to tend to the same thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Places of Scripture are three; the first is <i>Isa.</i> lxi. 1. the
Words are these, <i>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the
Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tidings unto the Meek: He hath sent
me to bind up the Broken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives,
and the opening of the Prison to them that are bound</i>&mdash;&mdash;So <i>Luke</i> iv. 18.
the Words in <i>Luke</i> are much to the same Purpose, and little Difference;
only that which <i>Isaiah</i> did prophesy of, it was fulfilled by
Christ in his time&mdash;&mdash;So the first Epistle of <i>Peter</i>, Chap. iii. and
18, 19, 20. Verses; the Words are these, <i>For Christ also hath once
suffered for Sin, the Just for the Unjust; that he might bring us to God, being
put to Death in the Flesh, but quickened by the Spirit</i>. Verse 19. <i>By
which also he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison</i>: Verse 20.
<i>Which sometime were disobedient, when once the Long-suffering of God
waited in the Days of</i> Noah, <i>while the Ark was a preparing, wherein few
(that is) eight Souls were saved by Water</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>As for that Saying of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, it was a Prophecy of
Christ, that he should be anointed to preach Glad-tidings,
unto the Meek, and that he was sent to bind up the Broken-hearted,
to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Prison
<a id='Page_27'></a>to them that are bound. This Prophecy was fulfilled when he was
upon Earth, as may plainly appear by those Words in <i>Luke</i> aforementioned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also the Reader may understand, that these Places of Scripture
have no Relation at all to the raising of Spirits without Bodies; nor
of Spirits being in Prison, nor delivered out of Prison by the Power
of Christ without Bodies.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Meaning is this, that the Spirit of the Lord Almighty
was upon Christ, and in him, and did anoint him to preach Glad-tidings
of Salvation to the Meek in Heart, who did believe in him
and trusted in his Words; all such as were broken-hearted, who
were led Captive by the Error, Ignorance, and Darkness of the
Mind; he came to proclaim Liberty to the Spirit of Man, who was
in Captivity; and to open the Prison-door of Mens Hearts.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this I say, all Mens Spirits by Nature are shut up in the Prison
of Spiritual Darkness in the Mind, and are lead Captive by the
Ignorance of Truth; so that the Spirit or Soul of Man is shut up
a Prisoner in the Body of Man, until the true God and Saviour hath
been preached to them, as it was by Christ himself, when on Earth
he was anointed to preach Glad-tidings of Salvation; and he
anointed his Apostles to preach Glad-tidings of Peace to Men, and
to open the Prison, and to deliver the Captive out of Captivity, and
to set the Spirits of many that were in a Prison of Darkness in their
own Minds go free: This Prophecy was fulfilled at that Time by
Christ and his Apostles in their Commission.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the same Captivity and Prison of Darkness is now upon the
Spirits of all Men, as it was at that Time: For this I say, and many People
can Witness, that their Spirits have been shut up Prisoners in Spiritual
Darkness in their own Bodies, until the true God the Saviour
hath been preached unto them by his last Messengers.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this I declare, that those Words of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, they
were spoken with Relation to a Spiritual Liberty, and to a Spiritual
Captivity, of the Mind or Spirit of Man, and not to a Natural
Captivity. Neither was it meant the opening of the natural Prison
Doors, to them that were bound by the Powers of the Nations; but
the Doors of Mens Hearts were opened at the preaching of Christ
and his Apostles, in that Light, and Life, and Salvation was preached
unto them, that whoever Believed that this Jesus is the Christ, the
Saviour of the World, should be saved and delivered from the Fear
of Eternal Death: So that the Soul of Man that was lead Captive
into Prison, and bound in Chains of Darkness, and strong Doors lockt
<a id='Page_28'></a>fast to keep the Spirit of Men in Prison, by the Works of the Law,
and the Expounders of the Law before Christ came, the Spirit of
Reason in them did lead the Generality of People their Spirits into
Spiritual Captivity, and shut them up in Prison, and tied their Spirits
up in the Observation of the Ceremonial Law of <i>Moses</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Which was as Chains of Darkness: and not only so, but shut the
Door of Hope upon them, so that there was no Hope to be saved in
them, but by observing the Law aforesaid, which <i>Paul</i> calls <i>beggarly
Rudiments</i>, <i>Gal.</i> iii. So that this Spiritual Captivity and being
bound in Prison, and the Doors being shut, it was the Spirits of People
that were Captives and Prisoners in their own Bodies, kept by
the Legal and Ceremonial Righteousness of the Law of <i>Moses</i>; and
when Christ came to preach, and to give Power to his Apostles
to preach the Gospel of Truth, both to Jew and Gentile, then
was the Door of Hope opened in People's Hearts, and many that
were bound in Prison, whose Spirits were led Captive, they
were set at Liberty from that Bondage of the Ceremonial Law,
wherein they were bound, and brought out of that Prison of Darkness
in the Mind, into the glorious Light and Life of Faith, by the
preaching of Christ and his Apostles.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then was this Prophecy of <i>Isaiah</i> fulfilled in the Apostles
Commission; then was Liberty preached to the Spirits of many that
were bound and in Prison in their own Minds, the Word of Faith
preached unto them, it opened a Door of Hope of Deliverance from
the Bondage of the Law as aforesaid, wherewith they were bound;
so that by Faith they had in Christ, their Chains fell off their Feet,
and Darkness of their Understanding; so that they were at perfect
Liberty, and delivered out of Prison, and the Prison-Door of Hope
in Christ being opened, all true Believers in Christ were set at Liberty,
free from Captivity, and out of that Spiritual Prison of Darkness
into the glorious Liberty of the Sons and Daughters of God for
ever and ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>So is it now in this Commission of the Spirit, we the Witnesses
of the Spirit have preached Glad-tidings of Salvation, and have
opened the Prison-Doors of Mens Hearts, and have let many out
of that Spiritual Prison, that were bound to the Righteousness set
up by the Imagination of Reason now in these last Days, who were
led Captive by their own Traditions, and kept in Prison in their
own Bodies for many Years; but by the Declaration of Truth in all
our Writings and our Speakings, many People have been delivered
out of Captivity and out of Prison, their Spirits have been let loose
<a id='Page_29'></a>out of the Chains of Darkness, because the Door of their Hearts hath
been opened by the Word of Faith in the true God, which we have
preached and written; this many can witness at this Day the Truth
of it. So that now that Scripture is fulfilled again these last days;
and this is the true Meaning of the Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, in those Words
concerning opening the Prison, and giving Liberty to the Captives
that were imprisoned in their own Bodies by the Conceptions of the
Imaginations of their own Hearts.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that there is not the least Colour or Ground from those Words,
for the Reason of Man to think that Spirits may be let out of Prison
without Bodies, or that the Spirit of Christ did Preach to any Spirit
in Prison without his Body.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>And as for those Words of <i>Peter</i> aforenamed, where he saith,
<i>Christ was put to Death in the Flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by
which also he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison, which sometime
were Disobedient, when once the Long-suffering of God waited in the Days
of</i> Noah, <i>while the Ark was a preparing, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>The Meaning of those Words are as followeth; that Christ was
put to Death in the Body of his own Flesh, this is confessed by most
People that profess the Scriptures of Truth, but very few do truly
believe, that the Soul or Spirit of Christ did die, or was put to Death
at all, notwithstanding the Scripture saith, that <i>He poured out his Soul
unto Death</i>; and he himself saith, <i>His Soul was heavy unto Death</i>. Therefore
that the Reader may understand what is meant in that Christ
was put to Death in the Flesh but quickened by the Spirit; mind,</p>

<p class='c004'>I declare, that it was the Soul or Spirit of Christ, which was the
Godhead-life that dwelt in that Body of Flesh and Bone of Christ;
for, as the Scripture saith, <i>In him all the Fulness of the Godhead dwelt
Bodily</i>: And this Godhead-life that dwelt in the Body of Christ's
Flesh, it was put to Death in the Body of Christ's Flesh, and
the same Godhead-life that was put to Death in the Body
of his Flesh. And when Christ's Body was crucified upon the
Cross, then was the Soul and Life of Christ, or the Godhead-life did
die, and was put to Death in that Flesh of Christ; for that Flesh of
Christ was God become Flesh, as the Scripture saith; and the Soul
and Life of Christ was the Soul and Life of God. And,</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_30'></a>When Christ poured out his Soul unto Death, it was the Godhead
Life that was poured out unto Death; so that the Godhead Spirit was
put to Death, and did die in the Flesh of Christ when he was
Crucified. But this Godhead Life which was put to Death in the
Flesh of Christ, it quicken'd again where it was put to Death, even in
the same Flesh where it was put to Death. And in its quickening
again, it raised the same Flesh again, and so spiritualized the same
Flesh that suffered, and made it uncapable to suffer Death any more.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this I say, no Spirit or Life that is put to Death whatsoever,
could possibly quicken again in the same Body, but the Life of God
only, so that Christ must needs be God as well as Man; for it was
Christ that was put to Death in the Flesh, and the same Life that was
put to Death, and did die, that which did die did quicken again,
and so is called a quickening Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now observe, it cannot properly be called a quickening Spirit, if it
had not been once dead: For if the Spirit and Life of Christ did
not die, nor was not dead, then I say, there was no need that this
Spirit and Life, should quicken again, for it was always quick and
alive.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the Spirit quickening doth imply, a sensible Life is quickned
out of an insensible Life; as a Child in the Womb before it is quick,
it feeleth no Pain, neither doth it stir in the Womb, and the Midwife
doth not care to destroy it to save the Womans Life, because the Child
was not quick, it was an insensible Life, no more capable of Pain then
there is in Death, or a dead Lump of Earth; but when a Child is
quick in the Womb, it is capable of Pain, though it hath not Strength
to express it to us that are strong, yet it is capable of Pain, because it is
quickened into a sensible Life, that is, a living Soul, a living Spirit,
and so may be called a quickened Spirit of Life, out of that which
was dead; yet by the Appointment of God in his Creation, and the
Warmness of the Womb, there is new Life or Spirit doth quicken in
the Womb in its Season, according to the Appointment of God when
he created all Things, and placed a Law of Generation in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise the Spirit or Life of Christ was put to Death in his own
Body of Flesh, as aforesaid; and in its Season he himself had
appointed before, namely three Days and three Nights, this Spirit of
Christ so put to Death, it quickened again in the same Flesh a new
and Glorious Life, which made that Flesh that suffered Glorious also.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this is the true Interpretation of <i>Peter's</i> Words, and the Faith
of all true Believers, that the Spirit, Life, and Soul of Christ did die,
and was put to Death in the Body of his own Flesh, that was Crucified
<a id='Page_31'></a>on the Cross by the Jews; and that the same Spirit that was put to
Death, it did quicken again out of Death into a new and Glorious
Life by his own Power, therefore called a quickening Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that here is no Ground at all for that vain Conceit in People,
who do believe that Spirits may be raised without Bodies, or appear
without Bodies, but altogether to the contrary. And as for that
saying of <i>Peter</i>, <i>By which also he went and preached unto the Spirits in
Prison, which sometime were disobedient, when once the Long-suffering of
God waited in the Days of</i> Noah <i>while the Ark was a preparing</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>These Words do seem to carry some shew, as if the quickening Spirit
of Christ, after he was risen from the Dead, or in the time he did lie
in the Grave, as if his Spirit in that Interim of Time went into some
local Place where Spirits were in Prison without Bodies, to preach
unto them, who had been Disobedient in the Days of <i>Noah</i>: This is
the vain Conceit of most People from those Words of <i>Peter</i>, who saith,
<i>By which he went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison</i>, as if the Spirits
of the Disobedient People in the Days of <i>Noah</i> had been in Prison in
some local Place in the Earth without Bodies, who had been departed
in the Days of <i>Noah</i>, in the Destruction of the World by Water.</p>

<p class='c004'>This the Imagination of Reason in Man doth imagine, that Spirits
may be shut up in Prison without Bodies, and that the quickening
Spirit Christ might Preach unto them without a Body.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the true Light and Revelation of faith doth know to the
contrary, that no Spirits can have any Being at all without Bodies,
neither of God, Angels, nor Man, nor no other living Creature, who
hath the Breath of Life in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>But to give the Interpretation of this Scripture, that the Reader
may understand, it is thus; the Spirit of Christ, that quickened
from the Dead to Life again, I say, is the same Spirit that preached
to the Spirits in Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>, and the Spirits of the
disobedient World were in Prison in their own Bodies in the Days
of <i>Noah</i>, as they were when Christ came upon Earth, for then he
opened the Prison to them that were bound, by preaching Glad-tidings
of Freedom to those that were bound, and Liberty to those
Spirits that were in Captivity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now (as I said before) this Captivity is Spiritual Captivity, and to
be bound and in Prison, it is meant a Spiritual Imprisonment in the
Mind, and not a natural Imprisonment of the Body. And this I say,
the very same Spirit of Christ that preached to the Jews when he was
upon Earth, did preach to the old World in the Days of <i>Noah</i>,
though in a twofold Manner.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_32'></a>And as the Spirits of Men were in Prison in their own Ignorance,
Blindness and Darkness of Understandings, in that they were led
Captives and Prisoners by their wicked and unnatural Lusts in the Days
of <i>Noah</i>: So were both Jews and Gentiles in the Days of Christ when
on Earth, their Spirits were led Captive, and into the Prison of Unbelief
and Persecution of the Lord of Life, in that their Fathers persecuted
the Lord's Prophets and Messengers he did send; so did these Jews
persecute the Lord himself, when he preached to their Spirits that
were in Prison, and led Captives by their wicked murdering Wills into
the Prison of Unbelief; for he did preach when on Earth, that whosoever
did believe in him should be saved. And as many as did truly
believe in him, their Spirits were brought out of that Captivity of
Unbelief, and out of the Prison of Darkness in the Mind, into a glorious
Liberty and Light of Life Eternal. And thus did the preaching
of Christ Spirit deliver many Spirits of Men and Women out of
Prison, in the Days when he was upon Earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise this quickening Spirit of Christ, it preached unto the
Spirits in Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>. And why were their Spirits in
Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>? Because they were disobedient. And
how may they be said to be disobedient? Because they did not believe
that good Man <i>Noah</i>, who was a Preacher of Righteousness. And
how did he preach Righteousness unto that wicked People? In that
he prepared the Ark, and being so many as a hundred Years in building,
all that while God is said to wait for their Repentance, and that
they might believe that God would destroy the World by Water.</p>

<p class='c004'>But instead of Repentance and believing they hardened their
Hearts, and mocked at <i>Noah</i> and the Ark; so that while the Ark
was preparing, God waited for the People's Repentance; and all that
while that <i>Noah</i> was building he preached to the People, that the
World would be drowned.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the Spirit of Christ, which is the Spirit of God which was
put to Death in the Flesh, but quickened by the Spirit, by which he
went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>,
it was the same Spirit that instructed <i>Noah</i> to build the Ark; so that
the building of the Ark by <i>Noah</i>, he being a Preacher of Righteousness,
in that he believed God, and built it as the Spirit of God had commanded
and instructed him; as God did <i>Moses</i>, shewed him the Pattern
of the Tabernacle in the Mount.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in as much as <i>Noah</i> did obey the Commandment of the Lord,
according as the Spirit of the Lord did reveal unto him, <i>Noah</i> may be
<a id='Page_33'></a>said to be a Preacher of Righteousness; and he doing all things by
Inspiration of the Spirit of Christ, which was not at that time
made of Flesh, but in the Fulness of time became pure humane
Flesh, and suffered the Pains of Death. And the same Spirit that
suffered Death, that very same Spirit that quickened, was that Spirit
that preached to the Spirits in Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>, as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the making of the Ark by the Inspiration of God's Spirit in
the Sight of the People, who were in Prison in Ignorance and Darkness
of Mind, is called by the Revelation of Faith, <i>A preaching to
the Spirits in Prison</i>: So that the Spirit of God in <i>Noah</i> may be said to
preach unto those Spirits in Prison, in the Days of <i>Noah</i>, and that
there was but eight Persons saved from the Flood.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that this Place of Scripture doth no way prove, that the Spirit
of Christ did ever preach to Spirits in Prison without Bodies;
neither did Christ's Spirit preach in the Days of <i>Noah</i> without a Body;
for he always preached with a Body himself, or else chose
Men that have Bodies, and gave them Power to preach to Spirits
in Prison, and to deliver the Captives, and to set the Prisoner at
Liberty, and the bound in Prison to go free.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Reader may see how and in what Manner the Spirit
of Christ did preach unto the Spirits in Prison in the Days of <i>Noah</i>,
and how their Spirits may be said to be in Prison, and how their
Unbelief in the Days of <i>Noah</i> was called Disobedience, to the preaching
of <i>Noah</i> all that while the Ark was building. And being built
by the Inspiration of the Spirit of God, it may and is called the
preaching of Christ's Spirit to them that were in Prison in Spiritual
Darkness in their Minds; for their Minds being darkened, they
did those Things that were unseemly; yea, unnatural as the People
of <i>Sodom</i> did. Now, were not the Spirits of these People in Prison,
and led Captive of those unnatural Lusts, I think no sober Man
will deny; yet these were those Spirits in Prison that Christ's Spirit
preach unto in the Body of <i>Noah</i>, in the Days of <i>Noah</i>; and
that there was but eight Persons in the Days of <i>Noah</i>, that were
saved from the Destruction by Water, by the preaching of that
Spirit of God in <i>Noah</i>. This is the true Interpretation and Meaning
of those Words of <i>Peter</i> the Apostle aforementioned; and how the
Spirit of Christ went and preached unto the Spirits in Prison in the
Days of <i>Noah</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_34'></a>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XIV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Again, there are some other Places of Scripture, which several
People have objected, as if the Spirit or Soul of Man
might go out of the Body, and subsist in Bliss and Happiness, or
in Misery and a tormented Condition, without its Body it always
lived in; from that Place <i>Luke</i> xxiii. 43. Jesus said to the Thief
on the Cross, <i>Verily I say unto thee, This Day shalt thou be with
me in Paradise</i>. Now observe, this no way proves that the Thief's
Soul went out of his Body into a paradisiacal Place, and so escaped
suffering Death, or did not die; for if the Soul of Christ did die at
that time, as is clear by Scripture it did; then the Soul and Life of
the Thief did die also.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then where was the Paradise the Thief's Soul, and Christ's Soul
that was heavy unto Death, where did they go? To this, I say,
they went to a Place of rest, where all righteous Souls go, which
is to the sleep of Death, for their was nothing did die but the Souls
of them both; and the Paradise Christ and the Thief went into
that Day they suffered Death, I declare it was this, that Christ was
sure in himself that he should rise from the Dead the third Day,
and afterward should enter into eternal Glory, and this Assurance
in Christ that he should rise again the third Day, it was Paradise
and Peace to his Soul, that he should pass through that Death, he
was now to suffer that very Day into a new Life, that should not
be capable to die any more.</p>

<p class='c004'>So likewise when the Thief did truly believe that Jesus was the
Christ, the Saviour from eternal Death to those that did believe;
as it is certain he did when he said, <i>Lord, remember me, when thou
comest into thy Kingdom</i>; for he did really believe, that Christ
would rise the third Day, and that he would raise him to eternal
Joy and Happiness at the last Day; and the Thief dying in this
Faith, he entred into Peace of Mind, and had Rest and Freedom
to die, in Hope and full Assurance that Christ would raise him up
Soul and Body to eternal Happiness at the last Day.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this was that Paradise that Christ and the Thief were in,
that very Day they both suffered Death; for the Assurance of everlasting
Life in a Man's self here in Mortality, is the Paradise of
Peace in this Life. This I know to be true, and this was the Paradise
Christ did mean the Thief should be in that very Day he believed;
<a id='Page_35'></a>and not that either of their Souls went out of their Bodies
to any other Place or Paradise, then what was in their own
Bodies, as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c004'>In like Manner People imagine, that the Soul of Man goeth out
of the Body at his Death, from that Saying <i>Acts</i> 7. 59. from those
Words of <i>Stephen</i>, when he was stoned to Death, he said, <i>Lord
Jesus, receive my Spirit</i>. The Meaning is this, that when any Man
died in the true Faith of Christ, in the Hope and full Assurance
that Christ will raise him up to eternal Happiness at the last Day,
he commits his Spirit into the Hands of Christ, knowing that
though he doth lose his Life for Christ's Sake here, that Christ
will raise it again, and save his Soul hereafter; and so Christ may
be said to receive his Spirit. For this I must tell the Reader, that
there is not a quarter of an Hour's time to the Dead to his rising
again, no not a Minute; for there is no time to the Dead, not a
Minute of an Hour, though a Man have been dead five thousand
Years, yet it is not a Minute of an Hour to him that is dead.</p>

<p class='c004'>For all time belongs to the living; for after Death there is nothing
but Eternity, on the other side of Death either eternal Happiness
or eternal Misery: So that when Men die, they may be said
to go immediately to Heaven or to Hell, to Joy or Torment, to be
receiv'd into Christ's Hands of Mercy, or into the Hands of Christ's
Wrath, where they shall be tormented with the Devil and his Angels,
yet shall never see the Devil, nor his Angels, nor themselves, to Eternity;
as they did not know the Devil here, neither shall
they know or see him hereafter, yet be tormented with him.</p>

<p class='c004'>And in this Sense a faithful Spirit or Soul, as <i>Stephen</i> was, may
be said to commit his Spirit into the Hands of Christ, and that
Christ doth receive his Spirit into his Hands, and will raise it up at
the last Day, which will not be a Minute of an Hour's time to the
Dead, as I said before; therefore let not the Seed of Faith think
the time long between Death and the Salvation of their Souls, because
so many of the Faithful have been so many hundred Years in
the Grave: And let not the wicked unbelieving People comfort
themselves, that the Dead shall never rise again, because
the Fathers are Dead, and the Prophets are dead, and we see none
of them rise again; therefore we conclude, their Spirits are gone
to Heaven without Bodies, and the Spirits of the Wicked are gone
to Hell without Bodies, but a Minute of an Hour's time will decide
this Matter, when the dead are raised: For they shall not remember
they have been a Sleep in the Dust one Minute of an Hour, for
<a id='Page_36'></a>their is no Remembrance of time in the Grave. Therefore let
that vain Conceit that is in most People fall, of Spirits going to
God without Bodies: For I can assure you there is no such Thing,
neither can there be any true Peace in that Conceit. I know it by
Faith now, and by Experience, for I was of that Opinion once my
self, when I was zealous in Religion according to the Puritan Way;
but I knew no Scripture truly, neither was there one true Interpreter
of Scripture, no not one in those Days, that could shew a Man
the true Righteousness of God, or the true Way to everlasting Life.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XV.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>There is another Place of Scripture that is objected, that
seems as if the Soul went out of the Body when they die; as
in 1 <i>Kings</i> xvii. 21. where <i>Elijah</i> prayed, that <i>the Child's Soul might
come into him again</i>. The Meaning is this, that <i>Elijah</i> did pray in
Faith unto God, that he would assist him in this or other Things;
as in shutting up the Heavens that it should not rain, and calling for
Fire from Heaven to destroy those two Captains and their Fifties,
and many other wonderful Things he did; so he prayed unto God
to strengthen his Faith, so that he might have Power to raise this
Child's Life out of Death again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore he stretched himself upon the Child, and prayed that
the Child's Soul might come into him again; that is, that the
Child's Soul or Life might quicken in the Body of the Child again; for
<i>Elijah</i> knew the Soul of the Child was dead, and by the warm Flesh
of the Prophet laid upon the Child's dead Flesh, and the Faith and
Prayer of the Prophet together, it begot Life in the Child again; so
that the Soul that was dead it became Life in the Child again; and
that Life that was quickened, it run through the Veins of the
Childs Body, and so the Child's Soul did come into him again.</p>

<p class='c004'>For this I say, if the Soul of the Child had been gone out of the
Body, then <i>Elijah</i> did not raise the dead Child to Life again; for
how can a Man be said to be dead, when as Life doth not die, but
slips out of the Body, as most People do vainly imagine; but it may
be clear to those whose Understandings are enlightened, that <i>Elijah</i>
did raise the Child from Death to Life, and that the Child's Soul
was dead in its Body, and that the Soul of the Child was revived
in the Child's Body again by the Power of Faith in <i>Elijah</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_37'></a>And the very same thing was done by the Prophet <i>Elisha</i>, as in
2 <i>Kings</i> iv. 34. the Prophet <i>Elisha</i> did the same thing to the <i>Sunamite</i>
Woman's Son, he <i>went up, and lay upon the Child, and put his Mouth
upon his Mouth, and his Eyes upon his Eyes, and his Hands upon his Hands,
and he stretch himself upon the Child; and the Flesh of the Child waxed
warm, and</i> Elisha <i>stretched himself upon the Child a second time</i>: Here
the Reader may see, that the Child was dead, and by the Faith
and Prayer, and by the Warmness of the Prophet <i>Elisha</i> his Flesh,
the Child revived to Life again both Body and Soul. And <i>Elisha</i>
did use the same Means and Way as <i>Elijah</i> did? for he went in and
shut the Door, and prayed unto the Lord as <i>Elijah</i> did, and
stretched himself upon the Child as <i>Elijah</i> did, and raise the Child
to Life again by the Power of Faith.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet <i>Elisha</i> maketh no mention of the Soul coming into the Child
again, but he delivered the Body and Soul of the Child, that were
both dead together, he delivered them both alive together to the
Child's Mother. It was the same thing done by <i>Elijah</i>, only some
difference in the Words, but the Sense and Meaning is all one.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Reader may understand, if any true Light of Life be
in him, that the Soul of the Child went not out of its Body, but
died in the Body; and by the Power of Faith in the Prophet, it
quickened alive out of Death in the Child's Body again; for the Soul
or Life of the Child never went out of the Body as is vainly imagin'd;
but the Soul, Life, and Spirit of the Child was absolutely dead in
the Body, and by the Power of Faith in the Prophet, the dead Soul
or Life of the Child was quickened alive again, and caused the Body
to live also. For if the Woman should have had the Soul of the
Child given unto her without the Body, she would have given the
Prophet no Thanks for raising her Child's Soul without a Body; but
the Body and Soul being one Person, they were both dead together,
and the Prophet raised them both together alive, and the Woman
received them both together, and rejoyced greatly in God, and gave
Honour to the Prophet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus in short, I have given the true Interpretation of all those
Scriptures that most seem, or most commonly are objected against
the Mortality of the Soul, or to prove that Spirits do go out of the
Body at the time of Death, or that Spirits may be raised without
Bodies, or have any Being without Bodies, or that a Spirit may appear
in a Shape without a Body, or that a Spirit can assume what
Shape it please, yet have no Body or Substance.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_38'></a>These things the vain Imagination of Reason in Man hath created
in it self, to fright it self with, for their is no such thing as Spirits
walking without Bodies, neither doth any Spirit go out of the
Body when Men die, as is imagined by most People; but these are
Fictions of Mens Brains, created by the Imagination in the dark
Minds of Men and Women, for God never created any such thing,
as I have shewed before.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as for that saying of <i>Solomon</i>, <i>Eccl.</i> xii. 7. <i>Then shall the Dust
return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God who gave
it.</i> His Meaning (I suppose) in these Words is, as is generally conceived
by all People, the Body to the Dust, and the Spirit returns
to God that gave it when Men die: But these Sayings of <i>Solomon</i>
are no Scripture, for <i>Solomon</i> was no Scripture Writer, for his Writings
were not written by the Revelation of Faith, but by the Revelation
of Reason; yet it was the purest of Reason, and he had the
greatest Measure of the Wisdom of Reason, and the Knowledge of
Nature, of any that was before him since <i>Adam</i>, or any that shall
come after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore God chose him King, and gave him the purest Wisdom
of Reason, according to his Desire in his Prayer to God, that
his Wisdom might resemble Heaven for Glory, as it did; for what
Glory could a King have upon Earth greater than he had? Which
was a true Resemblance of the Glory of Heaven; and this Glory
was procured by that Power and great Wisdom of Reason in him;
yet for all this he was ignorant of the Revelation of Faith, and of
spiritual and heavenly Things, ignorant of the true God, and of
the right Devil, and of some things in Nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>As that the Spirit of a Man should return to God that gave it
without a Body; when as God never gave any Spirit to Man
without a Body, nor to no other Creature: But <i>Solomon</i> being ignorant,
that the Spirit or Soul of Man is generated and begotten by
the Law of Generation as well as the Body; this was in the Creation
when God made Man in his own Image, the Ignorance of this
caused him to speak thus; for he knew not where the Spirit went
when the Body is laid in the Earth, no more than the learned Philosophers
do, who say, A Spirit cannot die; as if the Spirit and
Life of every Creature were the Spirit or Life of God, else they
think no Creature could move and have a Being.</p>

<p class='c004'>And though <i>Solomon</i> was a wise Man, as the Heathen Philosophers
were wise Men in Nature; yet they were all ignorant in this
one thing, of the Law of Generation or Procreation, to increase
<a id='Page_39'></a>and multiply, as God hath placed in Nature, when he created the
World in the beginning; for every Creature as well as Man,
were to increase and multiply by the Law of Generation; and this
I am sure, they begot Spirit, Life, and Soul by Generation, as well
as Bodies.</p>

<p class='c004'>But if it be objected, that God breathed into Man the Breath of
Life, and he became a living Soul; and so Man's Spirit is of a more
noble divine Life or Spirit than any other Creature.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this I say, the Law of Generation to increase and multiply,
was placed in Man's Seed and Nature by God the Creator, as in other
Creatures: For this is to be observed, that <i>Adam</i> did not come
to be a living Soul by Generation, as we do ever since; but he and
<i>Eve</i> were first made as a Foundation for Generation; so that God
made or created but one Man and one Woman, all Men and Women
that have been generated and begotten ever since, cannot properly
be said to be made nor created, but begotten by Generation;
for God never made and created but one Man and one Woman, all
others are generated and begotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore when Man begets a Son or Daughter in the way of Generation,
he begets the Soul or Spirit of the Child as well as the Body;
and the Soul or Spirit came out of the Man's Loin well as the
Body: As it was said by <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Seventy Souls came out of his Loins</i>; if
so then that Spirit or Soul that is begotten by Generation, it must
and doth die: For this I say, God never breathed the Breath of
Life into no Man, but into <i>Adam</i>: The Spirit of Life in all Men
and Women else or since have been generated and begotten, and
what Spirit and Soul of Man that is generated, it doth die and turn
to Dust, till the Regeneration, when God shall raise it again, which
will not be a Minute of an Hour to the dead Spirit, as I said before.
So it may be clear to those that have the true Light of Faith in
them, that the Soul or Spirit of Man doth die as well as the Body:
They both came into the World together alive, and they shall both
go out of the World again dead, as I have shewed before. Also
the Reader may see, that those Scriptures have been misunderstood
through the Ignorance and Darkness of Mens Minds, to think that
the Soul or Spirit of Man doth not die, but slips out of the Body;
but to imagine that Spirits may walk without Bodies, or that any
Witch can raise any Spirit without a Body; and many other Conceits
that do arise out of the dark Mind of Man; which have been
grounded upon those Scripture Words; therefore I have given the
Interpretation of all those Places of Scripture that are of most Concernment,
<a id='Page_40'></a>and seem to bear such a Sense, as is generally conceived
among Professors of the Scriptures: So that whoever understands
the Interpretation, may receive great Satisfaction in their Minds in
this Point; so much for Satisfaction of the Understanding in Heart,
and for the Discontent of the Ignorant and Dark-minded People, who
believe by Tradition that their Spirits do not die, but slide out of
the Body at the time of Death; and if they have been evil and
wicked Livers, their Spirits do walk afterwards, and cannot be at
rest. These Conceits have been exceeding brief in the World
heretofore, when People were in Darkness, and so is still where the
Darkness of Mind ruleth.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAP. XVI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>There is one thing more that would be necessary for the wise
in Heart to know, which the Scriptures speak of in several
Places; but I never heard any of the Ministry tell what that Satan
is the Scriptures speak of, therefore I shall speak a Word or two to
shew what Satan is, and so conclude. 1 <i>Chron.</i> xxi. 1. <i>And Satan
stood up against</i> Israel; and <i>Job</i> i. 6. <i>And Satan came also among them</i>;
and Chap. xxi. 22. <i>And the Lord said to Sathan, From whence comest
thou? And God said to Satan, Hast thou considered my Servant</i> Job?
Ezek. iii. 1. <i>And Satan standing at his right Hand.</i> Mat. xvi. 23.
<i>Get the behind me, Satan.</i> Luke x. 18. <i>I beheld Satan as Lightning
fall from Heaven.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>1 <i>Chron.</i> xxi. 1. <i>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked</i> David
<i>to number Israel</i>. This Satan that provoked <i>David</i>, it was the
Motions of Reason in himself, being lifted up in his own Mind, in that
he had overcome the Children of <i>Ammon</i>, he thought to make nothing
of the <i>Philistines</i>; therefore the Thoughts of his Heart moved
him to number the People, to know his Strength. And this Motion
that did arise in his Heart, it was Satan, it is called Satan, because
those Motions proceed from the Spirit or Seed of Reason in him. In
2 <i>Sam.</i> xxiv. 1. it is said, <i>The Anger of the Lord was kindled against</i>
Israel, <i>and he moved</i> David <i>against them to say, Go, number</i> Israel:
that is, the Lord suffered the Motions of Reason in <i>David</i> to be
powerful and strong in him, that no Arguments should disswade him
from it, but the People must be numbred; and this was that Satan
in <i>David</i>, and no Spirit without him.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_41'></a>So <i>Job</i> i. 6. <i>The Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord,
and Satan came also among them.</i> To this I say, the Book of <i>Job</i> is
no Scripture, neither are Men to build their Faith upon it, because
the Book of <i>Job</i> was written before <i>Moses</i>, therefore no Scripture;
for <i>Moses</i> his Writing is the first Foundation of Scripture. Yet this
I do confess, that <i>Job</i> was a good and faithful Man; and because he
was afflicted by Satan, and Satan is spoken of in several Places of
Scripture, yet none of them did declare what this Satan is, therefore
I shall declare now what that Satan was, that came among the
Sons of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>I declare, the Sons of God they were the Sons of <i>Job</i>, who feasted
their three Sisters, as you may read. They were called the Sons
of God, because they were that good and faithful Man <i>Job</i>'s Sons;
as the Sons of <i>Seth</i> were called the Sons of God, and <i>they looked upon
the Daughters of Men, and saw that they were fair</i>, &amp;c. as you may
read in <i>Genesis</i>. Now that Satan came amongst them when they
presented themselves before the Lord, it was the Spirit of Reason
in <i>Job</i>'s seven Sons, when they feasted their three Sisters, they
were moved in their Minds to Voluptuousness, Drunkenness and
Lust, as the rest of the Heathen were where they lived; so that
they did Wickedness in the Absence of <i>Job</i> their Father: And <i>Job</i>
fearing in their Wickedness his Sons had cursed God in their
Hearts, as you may see in the Verse before. So <i>Job</i> caused his Sons
to present themselves before the Lord, and to worship the Lord, as
it was the Manner for <i>Job</i> to do in those times, and Satan came with
them, that is, the Spirit of Reason in his Sons came with them,
reasoning in themselves; why should their Father <i>Job</i> reprove
them for their Wickedness in their Feasts; this was that Satan that
came amongst them, for he was in them, and no other Satan but
what was within them.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this is that Satan that goeth to and fro in the Earth, to
tempt and destroy those that are faithful: So that this Spirit of Reason,
this Satan, it goeth to and fro in the Earth, to tempt and destroy
the faithful.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was that Satan that did motion the <i>Sabeans</i> and <i>Chaldaeans</i> to
take away <i>Job</i>'s Oxen, and slay his servants as they were plowing;
and fired the Sheep, and burnt up <i>Job</i>'s Servants; and the <i>Chaldaeans</i>
came with a Band of Men, seeing <i>Job</i> smitten and destroyed by the
<i>Sabeans</i>; and they came with three Bands of Men, and destroyed
the Camels and the rest of his Servants.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_42'></a>For this must be minded, that in those Times there was no Law to
deliver or help the Innocent, but he that had the strongest Sword carried
the Day. And the Lord for Trial of <i>Job</i>'s Faith and Patience,
and for a Pattern for the Ages to come, he suffered the Spirit of unclean
Reason in the <i>Sabeans</i> and <i>Chaldaeans</i> to go to and fro in the
Earth, to stir up their People to destroy <i>Job</i> and all his House and
Cattle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also God suffered the natural Wind to blow down the House
where <i>Job</i>'s Sons were feasting, and destroyed them according to the
Desire of the Spirit of unclean Reason in the <i>Sabeans</i> and <i>Chaldaeans</i>.
For the Sons of <i>Job</i> were wicked Children, though called the Sons
of God.</p>

<p class='c004'>And last of all the Spirit of unclean Reason in <i>Job</i>'s Wife was that
Satan that tempted <i>Job</i> to curse God and die: So that there is no
other Spirit or Satan without Man: But that Satan spoken of in
<i>Job</i>, it was the Spirit of unclean Reason in the Minds of the <i>Sabeans</i>,
<i>Chaldaeans</i>, and in <i>Job</i>'s Wife and Sons; that was the Satan, and no
other.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as for those Disputes; God had with Satan, and Satan with
God; it was nothing else but the Motions of <i>Job</i>'s Heart passing
through his troubled Soul, the Seed of Faith disputed in him for God,
persuading him to be patient, and let that have its perfect Work, and
so Hope did increase in him; and the Seed of Reason, which was
Satan in him as well as in others, it pleaded against God, Reasoning
in him as if God did not do well or justly by him, that had been
so righteous in his Life, one who never did no Wrong to his Neighbour,
but always feared God; yet that God should suffer the wicked
to destroy his Cattle and Servants, and suffer the Wind to blow down
his House, and destroy his Children; and not only so, but suffer his
Body to break out with Boils and Botches most loathsome, as if he
had been the greatest Sinner in the World; so that he thought that
God dealt more cruelly with him then with any other Creature. And
further, he thought God dealt hardly with him, that he would
neither take away his Life, that he might die out of this troubled
Mind and Pains of Body, nor restore him to Health. These and such
like Reasonings and thoughts passed through <i>Job</i>'s troubled Soul even
from the Spirit or Seed of Reason in him, which is the Dispute of
Satan: For as the Seed of Faith in <i>Job</i> disputed for God so did the
Seed of Reason in <i>Job</i> dispute for Satan; for there is no other Satan
but what is in Man, as I said before.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_43'></a>So in <i>Zach.</i> iii. 1. here <i>Zachariah</i> the Prophet saw in a Vision the
Redemption of the Seed of Faith by Christ under the Type of <i>Joshua</i>
the High-Priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan
standing at his right hand to resist him. This High-Priest was Christ
clothed with filthy Garments, when he became Flesh, when on
Earth he appeared unto Men, to be clothed in filthy Garments,
being so mean, and had not a Place to lay his Head yet professed himself
to be the Son of God, the High-Priest that should offer up himself
for to save his People; for High-Priests in former Times did appear
to the People with rich and glorious Garments; but this High-Priest
doth appear to the Seed of Reason, to be clothed in filthy Garments,
not fit (as Reason thinks) to stand before the Angel of the
Lord.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this Satan that stands as his right Hand to resist him, it was
the Spirit of unclean Reason in those People of the Jews when Christ
was upon Earth, and when that Devil that tempted Christ, spoken of
in <i>Matthew</i>, disputed with Christ, he resisted the High-Priest, and
stood at Christ's right Hand at that time; and this Devil that tempted
Christ, it was a Man endued with an high Pitch of Reason, and
that Spirit of Reason, or Wisdom of Reason, in that Man that tempted
Christ the High-Priest, it was Satan that strove to resist Christ
in dispute, whereupon Christ said, <i>Get thee hence Satan</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This Satan was a Man, and the Spirit of Reason in this Man is
that Satan that always resisteth the Wisdom of Faith, which is the
Wisdom of God. But this hath been more largely treated upon in
our other Writings, so I shall speak no more of that Devil and his
Temptations here.</p>

<p class='c004'>So in <i>Matth.</i> xvi. 23. Christ said unto <i>Peter</i>, <i>Get thee behind me
Satan</i>. Here you see <i>Peter</i> is called Satan, because it was the Spirit
of Reason in <i>Peter</i> that said, Master, pity thy self: That is, the
Thoughts of <i>Peter's</i> Heart they did savour of the fleshly part, that is,
those Motions to persuade Christ to save himself from Death, they
did arise from the Seed of Reason in <i>Peter</i>, therefore called Satan; for
there was no new Spirit that came into <i>Peter</i> at that time to cause
him to speak those Words, but those Words proceeded from the
Seed of Reason in him, as aforesaid, therefore called Satan.</p>

<p class='c004'>And wheresoever that Expression is used, as <i>Peter</i> said himself in
the <i>Acts</i>, <i>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart to lie unto the Holy
Ghost?</i> that is, why hath the Motions of Reason in thee persuaded
thy Heart to tell a Lie unto us, that have the Holy Ghost in us?</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_44'></a>So the Reader may clearly see, there is no other Satan to tempt
God or Man, but the Motions and Words that proceed from the
Seed of Reason in Man and Woman.</p>

<p class='c004'>So in <i>Luke</i> x. 18. <i>And Christ said unto his Disciples, I beheld Satan
as Lightning fall from Heaven</i>. This Christ spake, because his Disciples
rejoyced that the Devils were subject to them. The Meaning
of Christ was, that he saw the Spirit of Reason, that was in the
Rulers of the <i>Jews</i>, very high in the Righteousness of the Law of
<i>Moses</i>, even as if they were in Heaven, thinking in themselves that
none could be more happy and surer of Heaven and Peace with God,
then they that kept to the Law of <i>Moses</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Christ knowing that this Righteousness of the <i>Jews</i>, should
be thrown down by the Righteousness of Faith, which his Apostles
should preach, therefore he saw by Faith that the Spirit of Reason
in the Rulers of the <i>Jews</i> should fall like Lightning from Heaven;
and so it did, and the Disciples of Christ should, by the Doctrine
and Righteousness of Faith, tread upon Serpents, and upon their
Persecution, and upon their Righteousness of the Law of <i>Moses</i>,
and upon all that which did fall like Lightning from Heaven; they
should tread upon Satan, that is, upon the very Wisdom of Reason
the Devil.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is the true meaning of Christ, when he beheld Satan fall
from Heaven like Lightning, and what Satan is so much spoken of
in Scripture. Much more might be said to enlarge this Point, but I
have spoken more already then I did intend; but I suppose there is
enough written here in short to satisfy those, that can understand by
a little what a great deal Means. And also People may know when
they speak of Satan what Satan is, and when they speak of the Devil,
they may know what the Devil is.</p>

<p class='c004'>So much concerning the Interpretation of Satan, and
the Conclusion of this Epistle, written by</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Lodowicke Muggleton</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <a id='Page_45'></a>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>A Copy of a Letter written by the Prophet</i> Lodowicks Muggleton, <i>to Mr.</i> Edward Fewterrill <i>of</i> Chesterfield, <i>bearing Date from</i> London March 29. 1660.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><i>Friend</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>I Received your Letter, wherein I perceive you are a Man that
hath been led through several Opinions, yet not suffered to
joyn with any, but have been made to wait upon Jesus Christ the
only God for Satisfaction; and now it hath been his great Love,
which he hath loved you, to let you have a Sight of those infinite
Truths, written by the Hands of his two Witnesses, and <i>Lawrence
Claxton</i>; which Writing of ours, I perceive by your Letter, have
given you more Satisfaction than any that ever you read before.</p>

<p class='c004'>Only this I perceive, that you did and do still much approve of
<i>Jacob Bemon</i>'s Works; and for this Cause, because you were as I perceive
by his Writings, exhorted to resign your Will unto God's
Will, and to come unto that happy State, neither to Will or Desire
any thing, but to abide in the Will of God, which is Jesus Christ,
into which Estate the Lord did twice bring you in some Measure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Also you say, That it is a hard thing to cast out that Devil that
is in us, nor can it be done as we say or think, but by that Resignation
and Faith in the true God.</p>

<p class='c004'>Likewise you say, that you were a great Disputant against all
Forms and formal Worship, till the Lord silenced you, and did let
you see it was but a vain Thing to wrangle and jangle with the
Devil more.</p>

<p class='c004'>But I shall pass by part of your Letter, and I shall answer you
to those things that are of most Concernment.</p>

<p class='c004'>You say, that there was that Portion of Scripture brought into
your Remembrance of his Promise, <i>I will send the Spirit of Truth,
which shall guide you into all Truth</i>, and there have you had your rest
reposed.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the last Place I find, that you would have some Answer to some
Doubts, concerning that Devil that doth appear to Witches, and
suck of their Bodies, and what that is that doth appear to Conjurers,
and the Authors of lying Wonders of <i>John Robins</i>; though you
do believe there is no Devil but Man, you do believe also that the
Soul of Man is mortal, and must needs die, and so cannot appear,
though you thought otherwise in your Reason.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_46'></a>You say, Whether is there a Spirit in Man that surviveth and is
allured by them, or do they stir up awaking the Power of the first
fallen Angel through their devillish Faith, or is these Things from
their vain Imaginations. If so, how? if not, what it is, is your
Desire to know of me.</p>

<p class='c004'>To which I shall give you some Answer both to the first of Part
your Letter, and also to the latter Part of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>First you say, that you have been made to wait upon Jesus Christ
the only God; for Satisfaction thereof, I would have you to
consider, how could you wait and be satisfied in the Belief of such
a God which you never knew. For the Letter of the Scriptures
did never declare to you, that Jesus Christ was the only God, neither
did God commissionate no Prophet nor Apostle for to declare
it, though their Declarations was as necessary to be believed in
their Time and Place, as this Commission of the Spirit; which
Commission of the Spirit hath deeper Mysteries held forth in it,
than the other two Commissions had: For God never did give to
any Prophets or Apostles, the Knowledge of his own Form or Nature
before he became Flesh. If they did know it, they did not
reveal it. But he hath given it to his two last Spiritual Witnesses
and Prophets, <i>John Reeve</i>'s and <i>Lodowicke Muggleton</i>, who were those
chosen Witnesses of God, which should have more Understanding
of the Mind of God in the Scriptures, than all Men in the World.</p>

<p class='c004'>Which Knowledge of God's Mind in the Scriptures, doth consist
of these six Heads.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>First</i>, Of the Form and Nature of God before he became Flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Secondly</i>, Of the Form and Nature of the Devil before he became
Flesh.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Thirdly</i>, Of the Place and Nature of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fourthly</i>, Of the Place and Nature of Hell.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fifthly</i>, Of the Nature and Persons of Angels.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Sixthly</i>, Of the Mortality of the Soul.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon the Knowledge of these six Principles, depends the eternal
Happiness of many. And the Knowledge of the two Seeds, is
those two Keys that doth open those two, namely, the strait and
narrow Gate that leadeth unto Life, and the broad and wide Gate
that leadeth to Destruction. And those two Keys are given unto us
two aforesaid, which hath the Commission of the Spirit given
unto us.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that there is no coming unto the Knowledge of the true God,
nor the right Devil, but where the Declaration of this Spiritual
Commission doth open the Doors or Gates of Mens Hearts, and
<a id='Page_47'></a>lets them see what Seed they are of, and so Men come to know
the true God and the right Devil. And then a Man may truly say,
that he can resign his Will to God's Will, as you say <i>Jacob Bemon</i>
in his Writings doth declare.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet this I would have you to know that <i>Jacob Bemon</i> had no Personal
God at all not to resign his Will unto, but his God was an
Infinite, Incomprehensible, Formless Spirit, as all the World hath.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither had his Devil a Person nor Form; neither had his Angels
he speaketh so much of any Body or Form at all, but they were all
Spirits without Bodies, which in the Conclusion was no more but
so many Letters, that is, three Letters, G, O, D, and so of the
Devil and Angels.</p>

<p class='c004'>And yet this Man would resign his Will into God's Will, and
yet his God had no Form nor Nature at all; therefore they could
be no Will in his God, whereby any Man should resign his Will
into God's Will; whereas there can be no Will in God, except he
hath both Form and Nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this is that Will of God which you call Jesus Christ, into
which Estate the Lord did twice bring you, which Estate of yours
in that Faith of <i>Jacob Bemon</i>'s, could not be a true Estate, because
there was not the Knowledge of the true God; and where there is
not the Knowledge of the true God, there cannot be the Knowledge
of the right Devil; without the Knowledge of these two, there
can be no true lasting Peace in Man.</p>

<p class='c004'>And as for your being a great Disputant amongst all formal Worship,
I do not question the thing, because I know that the Wisdom
of Reason, which is the Devil, doth love to be uppermost in
Disputes.</p>

<p class='c004'>But how can you say, that the Lord did Silence you, and made
you to see the Vanity of all Disputes; whereas you did not know
any other God, but what is generally believed on in the World;
that is, an Infinite, Incomprehensible Spirit, not minding whether
God had any Nature or Form at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore it could not be the true Lord that did silence you, but
it was something that did arise out of your own Seed, which
did shew you the Vanity of all Disputes.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the next Place you say, that there was brought into your Remembrance
that Portion of Scripture concerning his Promise, <i>that
he would send his Spirit of Truth, which should guide you into all Truth</i>,
and there have you had your rest reposed.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_48'></a>Answer, That this Place of Scripture did not belong unto you, nor
to any Man in the World at this Day; for that Promise was given
only unto his Disciples; which Disciples of his to whom those
Words were spoken, were afterwards made Apostles of Christ; so
that the Promise which Christ did promise to his Disciples before
his Death, was that of the Blood which was given unto his Apostles,
which was called the Spirit of Truth, because they should witness
unto the Truth; that is, unto his Death and Resurrection and
Ascension.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore take Notice of this, that that Promise was fulfilled
upon his Apostles after he was ascended up to Heaven, as you may
read in the second of the <i>Acts</i>, and to every Man that doth read
the Promises, which God did make to his Commissionated Apostles,
it doth not belong to every Man that doth read them, but every
Man is to mind that Commission which he is under.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore for you to repose your Trust upon such Promises as was
given to other Men in their Commissions, that Peace will not endure
to the End, but will vanish like Smoke in the Fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the next Place, I shall give you some Answers to those Doubts,
which you spake of concerning that Devil which doth appear to
Witches and Conjurers, and how those lying Wonders were acted
by <i>John Robins</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Answer, There is a twofold Witchcraft, the one is Natural, the
other is Spiritual.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now this natural Witchcraft is acted by such as are called Witches
and Conjurers. Now as for those ignorant Women which are
Witches, their Witchcraft lies in their wicked Nature, by giving
themselves up to believe, that there is no God at all but Nature only,
and so by that strong Faith that they have in Nature, they have
Power over those whose Understandings are of a lower Capacity
than themselves, and so People being ignorant and fearful of them,
doth many times disturb and search their Blood with Extremity of
Fear, which they have of one that is suspected for a Witch, and so
by their own Fear and Imagination, they come to be bewitched.
As a Man being overcharged with extream Grief, or being prevented
by one that he loves, he goes Distracted or runneth Mad, which
is no other but his being bewitched. And so it is with all those
that are ignorant, and over charged with Fear: and as for those
Children and Cattle that are bewitched, it is by some other Sorcery
which they do use with Herbs and Plants, and some other
things of Nature, they having some small Knowledge of that Sympathy,
<a id='Page_49'></a>and Influence the Stars have over those Bodies and Herbs,
and so mix their Faith and Experience together, pretending to do
all Manner of Good, but intendeth nothing but Evil. So that there
is no such thing as People do vainly imagine as for Spirits to suck
Witches, but all the Devil that is, is their own dark Reason; and
that Spirit that doth bewitch any Creature, it doth arise out of
their own Imagination: And as for Conjurers and Magicians, their
Reason is more enlightened than the others is, because they do go
altogether by the Figure, which is an Art by which the Reason of
Man hath produced Characters and Figures for the several Stars and
Planets, and so they came to imagine the Influence of those Stars and
Planets upon the Bodies of Men, and many times they do hit rightly,
yet it is still but Witchcraft. For it is nothing else but the Imagination
of Reason, that doth pry into the Secrets of Nature. And the
first Witchcraft that ever was, it was produced by learning of Numbers
and Figures; I say, it was first from the <i>Egyptians</i> Arts, and
from thence came Conjuration, and the Knowledge of the Influence
of the Stars and Planets and the Knowledge of Physick,
which are no other in the Original but Witches, only this their
Witchcraft is more tolerated by the Power of the Nations; but I
am confident that there is more People in the World bewitched
with them, than there is with the other Sort of Witches, that is,
they are deceived both in Body, and in Mind, and Estate. For
when a Man is deceived in his Expectations and Faith which he had
in that Art, he may very well be said to be bewitched: But as for
raising Spirits without Bodies, there is no Witch, no Conjurer, or
Magician, nor the greatest Artist in the World can do; neither can
any Spirit assume any Body but its own. So much for natural Witches.</p>

<p class='c004'>And for those lying Signs and Wonders which <i>John Robins</i> did
act, it was by a more Spiritual Witchcraft; his was not by the
Knowledge of the Stars, though he had some Skill in that too, but
the Power of his Witchcraft did lye in the assuming and taking
upon him the Title of the Great God, as you may read in our
Books: And so that his Reason being more exercised in the Scriptures
upon Spiritual Matters, because the whole Body of the Scriptures
doth consist of Spiritual and Heavenly Matter; and he having
more Knowledge in the Mystery of the Scriptures at that time than
all Men in the World, therefore he had many that did fall down
and worship him; because his Knowledge in the Scriptures, did surpass
other Men, and so produced Voices in himself, and could present
lying Signs and Wonders, unto all those that were deceived by
<a id='Page_50'></a>him, or that where afraid of him; yet he did not deal with Spirits that,
had not Bodies; but all that Wisdom and Witchcraft that he did shewn
it came or arose out of his own Spirit of Reason, which was inclosed in
his own Body.</p>

<p class='c004'>And there is the Influence of the same Spirit of Witchcraft doth
now remain upon those People called <i>Quakers</i>, notwithstanding there
seeming Holiness, for they have many Times such fleshly Fits falling upon
them, which doth seem as if they had the Falling-Sickness, and be
as Men dumb, and will not speak a Word for three or four Hours together,
and upon a Sudden they will break forth into strong Language, as if
the Spirit did immediately move them to speak. This I say, it is nothing
else but an Influence of <i>John Robins</i>'s Spiritual Witchcraft, which is produced
out of their own Spirit within them, and not from any Spirit
which hath no Body without them. And all this is, they have no Knowledge
of the true God or the right Devil.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore it is that the greatest Part of the World doth lie under
Witchcraft, either a Natural Witchcraft or a Spiritual Witchcraft, there
is a very few that is delivered from being under one or both of them;
there is none delivered but those that are come to have Faith in this
Spiritual Commission, which is now extant in the World; for Faith
in it doth lead Men to the Knowledge of the true God and the right Devil,
with all those deep Mysteries which doth depend on them, the Knowledge
of which doth free a Man from all Witchcraft whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore I would advise you to read the Books of ours called the
<i>Divine-Looking-Glass</i>, for that you may see there, that there can be no
Spirits without a Body, neither can any Witch or Conjurer raise any
Spirit without a Body: But these Conjurers may do through the Ignorance
and Darkness of Man's Reason, and that Fear and Belief that is in
the Ignorant, they may by their ignorant Power raise a Shadow of things,
as if they were real Bodies, or Spirits in the Shape of Bodies; as the
<i>Egyptians</i> did before <i>Pharaoh</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, they did seem to raise Frogs
and Grashoppers in the Sight of <i>Pharaoh</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>; but I say, they
were not real Frogs and Grashoppers, but Shadows of such things,
which as soon as ever the Witchcraft Power or Art was over, their Frogs
and Grashoppers were gone also, else would the King and his People
been as much troubled at those Frogs which the Magicians did bring
upon their Land, as they were with those which <i>Moses</i> brought up,
which went into their Houses. And now if <i>Moses</i> had not raised Bodies
as well as Spirits, or if he had raised Spirits without Bodies, they would
have been as little troubled at those things which <i>Moses</i> did, as they
were at those Shadows or seeming things, which the Magicians of <i>Egypt</i>
did. There is something more in your Letter you sent to me, but I
have not time at present to answer; <i>So resteth your Friend</i>,</p>

</div>
<p class='c003'><i>Loving Friend</i>, Calling to Mind the Letter thou readest to
me, which was sent thee out of the Country, I am moved
to present these Lines to the View of thy ponderous Spirit;
for as Words of Truth flowing from a real Foundation,
drew forth Humility and Love to God and
Man, from that Soul that hath received an hearing Ear, so likewise
thou mayst know the glittering Words proceeding from Man's
Carnal Wisdom, is that which hath occasioned many Men to be exalted
above Measure, and to imagine himself so essentially united to
the Divine Glory, that at length that Man hath been so bewitched
through the Adorations of Men and Women in deep Darkness, with
high Conceits of his own Spiritual Wisdom, that he hath been willing
to deny his creaturely Condition, and to embrace the Holy Titles
and Honour of an infinite Creator. Yea, and to say in his Heart
and Tongue also, that there is no Spiritual God or Personal Glory
in the least, but what is in Man only, notwithstanding, as sure as
the Lord Jesus liveth, both he and all that is in him must turn into
silent Death and Dust for a Moment, yea, and would so remain unto
all Eternity, if there were not a distinct personal Majesty living
without Man to raise him again, to everlasting sensible Glory or
Shame, according to the Royal Pleasure of that God, that neither
will nor can give his Glory to another.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>My Dear Friend</i>, be not deceived with Mens crafty Words, who
have no true spiritual Distinction in them; for if any mortal Man
have dwelling in him the eternal Spirit, all the Motions, Thoughts,
Words and Actions of that Man must needs be as pure, holy and
powerful as God himself, because thou knowest they proceed from
a pure, holy, and glorious Spirit: But of the contrary, if thou
perceivest a Measure of Light only abiding in thee, which thou in
Mercy hast received from an everlasting Jesus without thee, then
<a id='Page_52'></a>thou often seest Darkness in thee as well as Light. For Light entred
not into Sinners to make them spiritual Gods one over another, but it
shined into them to discover their natural Enmity continually warring
against a God of eternal Love towards them; and not only so,
but to prevent also their former Darkness from tyrannizing in them
for ever, yea and to consolate their elect Brethren by their spiritual
Experiences.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wherefore, from a Divine Gift which I have freely received from
an unerring Spirit, I say unto thee, that those Men which labour
to perswade their Hearers, that if they diligently hearken to the
Light that is in them, they may attain to such a Power, as to be
dead in this Body from all Kind of inward Darkness, Sin, or Evil,
have uttered the falsest Doctrine that ever was declared to Men.
Moreover, if the Light of Life Eternal be thy Guide, though must
needs know then, it was neither the justifying Light of Christ within
Man, no nor the Spirit of Christ without Man, that moved
those Men to speak or write to the People; but it was their own
lying Imagination which hurried them about to beget Proselytes to
themselves in the Man Christ Jesus's stead, who alone <i>is God over all
Blessed for ever and ever</i>. Amen.</p>

<p class='c004'>He that is born of God sinneth not, that is he is not left to his
own Heart to commit the unpardonable Sin of Unbelief in the true
God, in despising the Spirit of Christ Jesus, to be the only Lord
God of his Salvation. <i>He that believeth shall be saved, but he that
believeth not is condemned already</i>, not because he hath not believed in
a God, or Christ that is within him, but because he hath not believed
in a personal God or Christ that is without him, whose divine
Majesty is crowned with such immortal bright burning Glory,
that if he did not vail his fiery Nature within his own blessed Body,
the Glory of it is so transcendently infinite, that he in a Moment
would consume all created Beings to Powder. He that committed
that Sin of calling God a Lyar, which is the Sin of not believing in our
Lord Jesus Christ as aforesaid, or he that maketh glorious Pretences
of unfeigned Love to Christ and his tender-hearted People, and yet
secretly lyeth under the Power of carnal Filthiness; such a Man is
not only of his Father the Devil, (cursed <i>Cain</i>) but he also is a
very Devil himself. <i>He that saith he hath no Sin in him, is a Lyar,
and the Truth is not in him</i>; that is, he that saith Christ is so powerfully
risen in him, that all Motions, Thought and Desire of Sin
against God or Man, is perfectly done away, that Man is an horrible
Lyar, and a deadly Enemy to all humble and broken-hearted
<a id='Page_53'></a>Saints; for their natural rebellious warring against the Light within
them, and the Lord of Glory without them. Oh! my precious
Friend, for whom my Soul spiritually travelleth, till thou art
firmly established with glorious Things which are Eternal; not
with empty Notions proceeding from an imaginary God or Christ
within Men, only which with <i>Syrenion</i> Songs is very pleasing to the
carnal Ear, which may delude some undiscerning Spirits for a Season,
nor with Pharisaical Looks, Sighs and Groans, to be seen of
Men, which is nothing else but the Effects of Mens crafty Words
and Gestures proceeding from Man's fleshly Wisdom, which is abominable
in the Sight of our God, who is the Lord Jesus Christ in
the Eternal Heavens above the Stars.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>My beloved Friend</i>, give me leave a little to reason with thee,
about Things of the greatest Concernment: What excellent Truths
above other Men hast thou heard from the chief Speakers of the
<i>Quakers</i>? Didst thou ever hear them speak to the Purpose? Or
speak at all of any God or Christ, but what is in Man only?
Or didst thou ever hear them speak of a bodily Glory and Misery
to come sensibly to be enjoyed by the Saints in the highest Heavens,
and to be endured by the Serpents in this World at the Day
of eternal Accounts? Or dost thou see the Image or Likeness
the true Jesus in that Ministry, the true and living Jesus, rejected
not the Company of Publicans and Sinners, even when his Light
appeared not in them; but on the contrary, do they not rashly condemn
those Men that soberly oppose them, and shun the Company
of those that are not of their Opinion, as Serpents; much like unto
those Hypocrites of old, who said, stand farther off, for we are
more holy than you. Moreover, in all their Speakings and Writings
to the People, do they not make a grand Idol of the Word Light,
and occasion Men to worship it as their only God; as if meer Words,
were to be adored without a Person, or worshipped within the
Bodies of sinful Man as a God: Or as if those that enjoy true Light
in them, have such a Measure of God in them, that they stand in
no need of any God without them in the least.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>My Dear Friend</i>, thou knowest Men of unstable Spirits, Child-like,
or rather Fool-like, are easily taken with every Wind of Doctrine:
But if thou hast a Spirit of true discerning in thee, thou
wilt be made thorowly then to try the Spirits and Doctrines of
Men, whether they be of God or no, before thou embrace them;
having been in the Fire of the Devil already, I hope thou hast
gained Experience. Wherefore for thy clearer Sight concerning of
<a id='Page_54'></a>the Fallacy of all Speakers, which say, the Lord <i>Jehovah</i>, or <i>Jesus</i>
sent them, I shall give some discovering Characters; he that saith
the everlasting spiritual God or Father, became not a perfect Man
of unspotted Flesh, Blood, and Bone, was never moved by the
Spirit of God or Christ, to preach or speak to the People; or he
that saith, that Spirit which is dwelling in the glorious Body of
Christ Jesus, is not the alone everlasting Father, God and Man
in one distinct Person glorified, is none of Christ's Messenger; or
he that saith, God is not in the Form of a Man, but is an infinite
Spirit essentially abiding in all Creatures, that Man is a Lyar, and
the Truth is not in him; or he that saith, Christ's Godhead died
not in the Flesh, and did not quicken and raise his Manhood to Life
again, and in that Body of Flesh and Bone, did not ascend into a
Kingdom of Glory in another World, the deep Things of God is
utterly hid from that Man; or he that saith all Mankind proceeded
from the Loins of the first Man <i>Adam</i>, is ignorant of the two Scripture
Seeds (namely) the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the
Serpent, therefore he is none of Christ's sending; or he that saith
Mens Souls do not die with their Bodies, and sleep together in the
Dust of the Earth, till the Lord Jesus by the mighty Power of his
Word speaking only, do raise them unto Life again at the last Day,
that Man is in deep Darkness, not knowing the Scriptures or the
Power of God; or he that says Mens Bodies only perish (and not
the Souls) will be saved at the last, that Man is a Lyar, and the
Truth is not in him.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Dear Friend</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus far was I moved to write unto thee, as an eternal Witness
between us, when the Secrets of all Hearts shall be opened. If
thou seest good, thou mayst present this Epistle to the View of
those Men called <i>Quakers</i>, not that I can expect a good Issue from
any of them, unless God hath endowed them with hearing Ears,
unjudging, meek and patient Spirits.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>An Epistle of</i> <span class='sc'>John Reeve</span> <i>to Mr.</i> <span class='sc'>Hill</span>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Dear Friend in the eternal Truth, my Love to you
and the rest of our Spiritual Friends remembred.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Brother</i> Hill,</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems very strange to me, That you with the rest of former
Friends, make no Enquiry after me whether I am dead or alive.
What have the unnecessary Things and Cares of this World swallowed
up your former Love to the Truth? Though I am moved
in this manner to write unto you, I trust you have not so learned
Christ.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Friend</i>, The Reason of my not sending unto you this long Season
is this, because my Wife and I were both very sick and weak, of
which Sickness the 29th of <i>March</i> last my Wife died.</p>

<p class='c004'>Immediately after I had buried my Wife, the Lord our God called
me to visit some of his People living near <i>Cambridge</i>, as he once
called me to visit you; yea, it was in the very same Manner: For
one of the chief Speakers of the <i>Ranters</i> being convinced by this
Truth, who formerly had deceived them, took a Parcel of my
Books and presented them to them, upon which they greatly desired
me as you formerly did; I hope there is about half a Score of
them that have received the Truth in Sincerity of Heart, they are
Husbandmen and Tradesmen that Labour for their Bread as you do;
they rejoyce in those that really possess this Truth though by Face
unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Christopher Hill</i>,</p>

<p class='c008'>You seem to forget your Engagement to your Father-in-Law, you
know the Time is expired concerning your Payment of the Money,
which was lent to you, and not to him; wherefore as you love the
Truth, I desire you to send me the Money remaining behind
speedily, that I may restore it to the right Owner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now concerning my own Condition it is thus; on <i>May Day</i> last,
I was Senseless two or three times, insomuch, that if a faithful
Friend had not been by me to relieve me with a little Cordial, I
had immediately died. I still continue very sick and weak, so
that of Necessity, I must either mend or end in a little Space. As
for Relief now I have most need of it, it hath been very
small of late; I wish it may not be a Burthen to the Conscience of
<a id='Page_56'></a>some when I am gone; the Widow's Mite will be a Witness against
all Carnal Excuses in those that own this Truth. It may be you
may think, I have no need of your Charity now, because the Merchant
for a little Season allowed me a small Matter Weekly; but if
you think so, you are much mistaken, for I have had none from him
a pretty while, neither do I know whether I shall have any more
from him at all: For when he took Ship for <i>Barbadoes</i>, he had not
wherewithal to leave his Wife and Children, through the unjust
Dealings of unreasonable Men. Brother <i>Hill</i>, You may remember
you sent me Word, that if the <i>London</i> Christians would contribute
Weekly or Monthly to my Necessity, you would do the like, you
will do well to keep your Covenant.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so I commit you to the most High, and remain yours in all
Righteousness,</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John Reeve</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>My Dwelling is in <i>Bishopsgate-street</i> near <i>Hog-lane</i> End, with three
Sisters that keep a Sempstris Shop.</p>

<p class='c008'>Direct your Letters to our Brother <i>Muggleton</i>, to be conveyed to
me, and the Money to him for me, you know where he
dwells; it is in <i>Trinity-lane</i>, over against a <i>Brown-Baker</i>'s.</p>

<p class='c004'>I Have received your Letter and your kind Token, for which I

<p class='c004'>As for my Neglect in Writing to you, my great Troubles of Sickness
and Mortality hath hindred it, I hope whilst I am able to write,
for time to come, you shall not charge me with any such Neglect;
in the mean Season, I do not desire your Charity unless you can spare
it. Remember my kind Love to your Mother <i>Wyles</i>, to <i>Tho. Martin</i>,
and Goodman <i>Young</i>, and I rejoyce in the Lord for you, that
the Truth abides in you. As for the Money, I am glad of your Care
for the Truths sake, because it was lent to me upon that Account.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_57'></a>No more at present, but desiring my God abundantly to establish
you in all spiritual Excellencies, unto whose infinite Grace I

<p class='c003'><i>Brother</i> Hill, <i>in the Eternal Truth</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>My Love to you and the rest of our Friends; this is a Spiritual
Love Letter that I am moved to write unto you, wherefore
by Virtue of my Commission, I pronounce thee <i>Tho. Martin</i>, <i>William

the Remembrance of this the Lord's Blessing, will do you no
harm when I am in my Grave; in the mean Season, our good God
cause you to love one another more than your temporal Enjoyments,
and that will become a Heaven upon Earth in your innocent Souls;
Faith fetcheth Spiritual Comfort, the Fountain to each particular
Soul; but Love fulfilleth all Righteousness both to God and Man.
Oh! the transcendent Excellency of the Love of Christ in his
new-born People, it is not to be express'd by the Tongues of
Men or Angels.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>A Copy of a Letter wrote by the Prophet</i> <span class='sc'>John Reeve</span> <i>to Mrs.</i> Alice Webb, <i>containing her Blessing and the Six Principles, on</i> August 15. 1656.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><i>Loving Friend</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>Desiring your Eternal Happiness in that Place of Glory
above the Stars, I am moved from the Spirit of the Lord to
write these Lines unto your Serious Consideration.</p>

<p class='c004'>This I know assured as God knows himself, that Jesus Christ from
his Throne of Glory, spake to me by Voice of Words three Mornings
together, which Speaking of his hath opened my dark Understanding
to declare such Spiritual Light to the Chosen of God, as
never was so clearly manifested before, especially in these Six Foundations.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_58'></a><i>First</i>, What the Person of the true God is, and his Divine Nature.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Secondly</i>, What the Persons of the holy Angels are, and their
Nature.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Thirdly</i>, What the Persons of the Devils are and their Natures,
and what the Person of the Devil was before he became a Devil,
and begot Millions of dark Angels or Devils, it being all one.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fourthly</i>, In what Condition the Man <i>Adam</i> was created in, and
by what Means he lost his first estate and the Effects of it.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Fifthly</i>, What Heaven and Glory is, and the eternal Residence
of it.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Sixthly</i>, What Hell and eternal Death is, and the Place where it
shall be to Eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>This I know certainly, That before the Lord sent me to declare
his Pleasure unto his People, no Man upon this Earth did clearly
understand any one of these Six Fundamental Truths, which to understand
is Life Eternal, and to be ignorant of them is Death
Eternal. Now the Lord hath sent his two Messengers to declare
them, I mean, to all those that may be informed in these Spiritual
Things, and do reject us (that are the Lord's Messengers of these
Things of Salvation) through the Love of carnal Things, they
must all perish to Eternity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, We know from the Lord by that infallible Spirit that he
hath given us, of divers Persons that shall be eternally blessed
with us: and all that we pronounce Cursed to Eternity are eternally
Cursed, as sure as Jesus Christ the Lord of Life is Blessed, because
it is his Curse and not ours.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, If the Lord Jesus do not bear Witness unto our Testimony,
and make it evident that he hath sent us in a few Months,
then you may conclude, that there never was any true Prophets nor
Christ, nor Apostles, nor Scripture spoken from the Mouth of God
to Men. But there is nothing but the Wisdom of Men and Nature
their God. But this we know, that those that are joyned with us, are
Partakers of those Truths, and shall be blessed for evermore, and shall
in the mean time patiently wait for the fulfilling of our Prophecy, and
shall have Power over their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, purifying
their Hearts by Faith in the Person of God even as he is pure, trampling
all the Riches and Honour of this World, under the Feet of
their Souls as Dung, because they have tasted of that Glory to come,
that no Tongue of Men or Angels can express, and this makes them
not only love one another in carnal Things, but for the Truth's sake
they are ready if (need require) to forsake all Relations, and Life
<a id='Page_59'></a>itself for one another; and is that Power of that one only Faith
and Truth, declared from the Spirit of God, the Man Jesus by us,
which none enjoys but those of this Faith.</p>

<p class='c004'>Much more might I write, but speaking Face to Face, (if it may
be) is far more profitable: <i>Farewell</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>An Epistle of</i> <span class='sc'>John Reeve</span> <i>to a Friend, written in</i> May 1657.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><i>Shewing</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>That Elect Angels are distinct from him who visibly beheld
him Face to Face, and what that Reprobate Serpent-Angel
was in his Creation, which by the secret Council and unsearchable
Wisdom of God, fell from his created Glory like Lightning
from the invisible Heaven above, to this visible Earth beneath;
and through his super-seeming God like Counsel, he overcame
innocent <i>Eve</i>; and she yielding unto him, he wholly entred
into her Womb and naturally changed himself into her Seed, and
so became the first-born Son of the Devil, and afterwards a cursed
<i>Cain</i>, and the Father of all those <i>Cananitish</i> Reprobate Angels, spoken
of in the visible Records of the Scriptures; <i>Not as</i> Cain, <i>who
was of that wicked one, and slew his Brother</i>, the 1st of <i>John</i>, the 3d
Chapter, and 18th Verse. <i>And the Tares are the Children of the
wicked one</i>, <i>Math.</i> 13th Chapter, and the 18th Verse. Also in
what Condition <i>Adam</i> was created in, and how he come to fall
from his created Estate, and what that sin was that <i>Eve</i> and he
were guilty of, and how Sin came first in their pure created Natures.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, what that heavenly Glory is and where it is, that God's
Elect Wheat, which are the Seed of <i>Adam</i>, and not of <i>Cain</i> shall possess
when time shall be no more, and what that shameful Eternal Death
is, and where it is reserved for the Seed of <i>Cain</i> and not of <i>Adam</i>,
who are either a Spirit given up to Persecution of Mens Consciences,
or else they are left in Darkness to condemn the Things of Eternity,
because they cannot comprehend them for want of a true distinguishing
Spirit, which is a Gift of the Holy Ghost, unto him which
<a id='Page_60'></a>is immediately sent by the Lord of Glory, that he may be distinguished
by the new born of God, from all those counterfeit or deceived
Preachers or Speakers in the World, who are apt and ready
to judge Men in Darkness, if they soberly ask them needful Questions
concerning things of Eternity; the understanding of those
glorious Excellencies, which is the Saints Inheritance, being utterly
hid from them, because they went before they were sent.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Friend and Brother in the Eternal Truth</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>By this infallible Demonstration, you may know a Man that hath
not a Commission from the true God, to preach and speak unto the
People.</p>

<p class='c004'>If a searching Speaker or Writer, deliver any thing unto those
People that joyn with him, then for fear of his Weakness or Ignorance
being discovered, he will counsel the Hearers to stick close
to the Ordinances in the Word of God, or to hearken to them, or
to that in their Consciences, and to beware of false Christ's and
false Prophets, and such like borrowing Scripture Languages, to
prevent the People of ever hearing the Glorious and Dreadful Things
of Eternity from the ever-living God, revealed both by Voice of
Words without, and Inspiration within, unto his two last despised
true Messengers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus it is clear, they have not the true Spirit of <i>Paul</i> in them,
who gave the true Saints Liberty to try all Things or Opinions of
Men, (for that was his Meaning) but to <i>hold fast to that which was
good</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, that Speaker or Preacher to People, whether publick or
private, that declares against all Appearances that are contrary to
his Way, discovers himself to a discerning Spirit, not to be of the
Lord, unless he can demonstrate a Spiritual Commission received
by Voice from Heaven, from the Mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ,
so that no Man can disprove him, though few from a true Understanding
received him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, he that preaches or teaches only of a God or Christ in
Mens Consciences, doth he not question the Scripture Records concerning
the Resurrection and Ascension of the glorious Body of the
Lord Jesus Christ, who through Faith in his invaluable Blood-shedding,
the Consciences of the Elect being sprinkled, are purified
from the Power of all Unrighteousness of Flesh and Spirit, and so
doth he not question the Resurrection of Mankind after Death.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again if after Death there be no bodily Resurrection for the Spirit
to possess an immortal God-like Glory, or to suffer an eternal
<a id='Page_61'></a>Devil-like Shame, according to their Deeds done in their Bodies;
is it not one of the vainest Babblings under Heaven, for Men to talk
of a God or Christ, or of Righteousness, or Purity, or Mercy, or
pure Love without Envy, or of any Spiritual Excellency whatsoever,
unless it be for Gain or Glory amongst Men.</p>

<p class='c004'>The eternal Spirit and alone everlasting Father, which essentially
reigneth in the glorified Body of our Lord Jesus Christ his eternal
Son, and spiritually, or motionally, or virtually liveth or reigneth
in elect Men and Angels, bear Record between me and you for Everlasting,
or World without end, whether this Witnessing be not
sent unto you, and all the Elect that shall view it principally for the
re-establishing of your tender Spirit, upon that spiritual Rock of
all Ages, the Lord Jesus Christ God and Man, in one distinct Person
Glorified and everlastingly Honoured, with all Variety of Spiritual
new Songs and Praises, from his Redeemed or Elect Men or
Angels, when all Time or Times is swallowed up into Eternity or
Eternities.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Another Epistle of</i> <span class='sc'>John Reeve</span><i>'s</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class='c004'>Your Replication to mine doth but still harp upon the same
Matter as your former, and yet you suppose you have given
such Arguments as may quite silence my former Assertions, were
that there are no Spirits without Bodies, but such as mere Shadows;
and that God is not a bodiless Spirit, but hath and ever had Form,
Substance, and Shape, and that is no other but the Form of a Man.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is contradicted by you, and so you affirm these Particulars
following.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>1st</i>, You take at those my Words which said, that if a Spirit have
no Body or Shape, then it is no more then a meer Shadow: This
you deny, by saying, that a Shadow is only privative, but a Spirit,
say you, is positive.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>2dly</i>, You further say, that there is such immaterial Substances,
which have a separate Existence from such gross Bodies which we
have about us; witness say you the Soul of Man, which is immaterial,
and lives after the Body is dead, which is, say you, confirmed
<a id='Page_62'></a>by <i>Paul</i>, 2 <i>Tim.</i> i. 10. which saith, that the <i>Gospel brings Life
and Immortality to Light</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>3dly</i>, This Doctrine, say you, was known by the Light of Nature
to the Heathen Philosophers, and hath since been confirmed
by Scripture of the New Testament to us, and so conclude it no
ways repugnant to right Reason.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>4thly</i>, You charge me with quoting the Scripture falsly, when I
said, that Christ reply'd to the young Man, saying, <i>That no Man was
good but one, which was God</i>; therefore say you, it is false that the
Scripture saith, that God is a Man.</p>

<p class='c004'>To each of these take this particular Answer, 1. If your Spirit
have neither Shape nor Substance, it is but a Shadow, and no more
then what the <i>Egyptians</i> Sorcerers produced before <i>Pharaoh</i>, what
<i>Moses</i> brought up were real Substances, but their's no other but Shadows,
but therefore a Spirit without Substance is not positive; for
that which is privative can have no Being without a positive, because
that which is positive hath a Being or Substance: Now he
that will not admit God to have a distinct Being of himself, his
God that he worships is nothing but a Shadow.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>2dly</i>, Where you speak of Spirits being immaterial Substances;
if they be immaterial, how are they Substances, and what Existence
can they have, and how can a Soul be immortal in a mortal
Body; it is said, <i>the Soul that Sins, it shall die</i>; yet say you, it is
immortal and cannot die, and would prove it in 2 <i>Tim.</i> i. 10.
when as that Place shews plainly, that it was Christ's Death
and Resurrection which <i>brought Life and Immortality Light</i>; so that
if there be not a Resurrection, then can there be no immortal Life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Therefore it is, that the Scriptures doth affirm, that there can be
no Salvation without a Resurrection, so that if the Dead should not
rise, then were all Faith vain, and God the God of the Dead (seeing
Death is not abolish'd) and not of the Living; so that there is no
Spirit that can subsist or have any Existence without a Body, either
Spiritual or Natural.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, doth not the Gospel <i>bring Life and Immortality to Light</i>,
and is this Life and Immortality brought to Light without a Body,
but it will have a Spiritual Body suitable to that mortal Spirit made
immortal. And doth not the Scripture affirm, that it shall have a
Body like unto God's own Glorious Body, and yet you say, God
hath no Body, and a Soul hath no Body.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do you not read also, that Christ had a Body, and that it was after
the <i>express Image of his Father's Person</i>: Would you trace substantial
<a id='Page_63'></a>Truth into an Allegory, and say Righteousness, Knowledge,
and Holiness is the Image of God, and yet must have no
Body to act for it self in. When God said, <i>be ye holy, as I am holy</i>,
must we turn our Souls out of our Bodies, to make them like your
bodiless God.</p>

<p class='c004'>When we are said to worship God in Spirit and Truth, is this
spiritual Worship performed without a Body, although there is a
Mental, Privy, and Praise without a vocal Expression, yet it must
arise from a Heart, and that Heart must be placed in a Body.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no Light without a Sun, no Stream without a Fountain,
and no Spirit without a Body.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>3dly.</i> As to your third particular, this I must tell you, that no
Light of Nature can discover Spiritual and Evangelical Truths,
and it is very gross for any Man to subject the Spiritual Truths of
the Gospel, to the heathenish Principles of Philosophers, making
the New Testament no other but for the Confirmation of the Principles
of Nature, which Nature you call right Reason, which say,
you never repugns the Gospel, nor the Gospel it.</p>

<p class='c004'>By this your Discourse I find, that you own that Christ came,
but to confirm the heathenish Principles of Nature, as, that God,
and Spirits, and Angels, were all without Bodies, being immaterial
Beings, and you know not what.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now give me leave to be plain with you, and to tell you, that I
could never read that the Gospel of Christ was ever sent to enlighten
Nature, Nature or Reason hath no Interest in it at all. In
the moral Law it hath, and therefore it is written, <i>the Law came
by</i> Moses; and what to do, but only to enlighten Reason unto
whom the Law was given: But as to the Gospel, <i>it came by
Jesus Christ</i>, and particularly belonged to another Seed; namely, <i>to
the lost Sheep of the House of</i> Israel; so that you can no more distinguish
between the Law and the Gospel, than between the two Natures
of Faith and Reason, it is all a Mystery to you. Do you
know what right Reason is, if you do, you must ascend up into
the Kingdom of Heaven, and view it in the holy Angels; for you
will not find neither pure, nor right, nor uncorrupted Reason any
where in this Orb below the Stars: For it is evident that Reason,
Notion can never be capable to comprehend Spiritual Truths, as
from the Power of its own Nature, it only serves to comprehend natural
and temporal Things, it being but natural it self; but Gospel
Truths are comprehended by another Light, according as it is
written by <i>David</i> saying, <i>in thy Light shall we see Light</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_64'></a>So that from what is said, we need not fear (as the World have)
of the Heathens rising up in Judgment against us, for maintaining
Gospel Truths against their Darkness of Reason.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>4thly</i>, As to your fourth Point, where you charge me of fathering
upon the Scripture those things that are not, and you make a Wonderment
of it, that I should say, that God was a Man, and to
quote Christ's Words for it, telling the young Man, <i>that there was no
Man good but one, which was God</i>; this you tell me was false, for you
say, the Text saith that <i>none is good but one, which is God</i>. Here your
Ignorance appears very great, and may be wonder'd at, considering
your great Learning and continual Study; but it appears, it is but
in those heathenish Philosophers; for observe for better Instruction,
did not that young Man call Christ Master, and own him to be a
Man and no more: Now to this you may find that Christ's Answer
did tacitely imply, that if he was but a Man, he was not perfectly
good, and that no Man could be perfectly good.</p>

<p class='c004'>And furthermore, for a more full Answer in the Old Translation,
attending to mark it, is render'd thus Word for Word, <i>that there
is no Man good but one, which is God</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is plain Scripture, and yet you are ignorant of it; I perceive
you are not very conversant in Scripture, your Philosophy
turns you out of all Scripture Knowledge. But to proceed farther,
cannot you find by Scripture, that God was ever called a Man, did
not you ever read that Scripture that saith, <i>God was a Man of War</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Much more might be said of this, and several positive Proofs from
Scripture might be produced to confirm it withal, but because it is
not the general received Opinion, therefore it must be quarrelled with;
for the Honour of this World must be both sought after and submitted
to.</p>

<p class='c004'>And whereas you farther say, that the Apostles of Christ did
ever teach after they had received their Commission, that Spirits
were immaterial and could subsist without Bodies, now answer
to this:</p>

<p class='c004'>It is most certainly evident, that the Apostles never taught, that
any Spirit could subsist without a Body, but the contrary altogether;
for their Doctrine was, that as the Soul and Body lives together,
so it dies together, and at the Last Day rises together, and is
ever without Separation.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Apostles said, <i>That many Spirits were generate into the
World, which denied that Christ was come in the Flesh</i>, did he mean Spirits
without Bodies: And when <i>Paul</i> said, <i>that the Spirit speaketh
<a id='Page_65'></a>expresly, that some shall depart from the Faith</i>: Now what Spirit was
that, but <i>Paul</i>'s own Spirit of Faith, in his own mortal Body; for
without a Tongue it could not be expressed.</p>

<p class='c004'>And where the Apostles tells of the Doctrine of Devils, were
those Devils bodiless, and teached damnable Doctrine.</p>

<p class='c004'>So that the Apostles never taught that there was any Spirits without
Bodies, but always Spirit and Body went together, and so makes
Longitude and Latitude profoundly, as your Philosophical Notions
teacheth, although you cannot apply it to any sublime or
spiritual Thing, you knowing nothing of it, but all is nothing and
of no Substance; and so in that your Darkness I leave you, seeing
you are no Friend to the Light; and rest yours in all civil Respects,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>John Reeve</span><i>'s, the only true Witness unto the very
true God, amongst many pretended Spiritual Messengers
in this confused Age</i>.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>An Epistle wrote by the Prophet</i> <span class='sc'>John Reeve</span> <i>to</i> <span class='sc'>Isaac Pennington</span>, <i>Esq; dated 1658. concerning an Answer to a Book of his, with several Mysteries and Divine and Spiritual Revelations declared by the Prophet, concerning God's visible appearing in the Flesh</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>In your Self-return, you seem to mourn over the sunk Spirit of
both Creations, so termed by you. Also you write as though
many from a Satanical Spirit write most accurately, both of the
Works of Creation and Mystery of Redemption by an immediate
Gift of God from our Lord Jesus Christ. To this I answer, a little
Season will produce Mourning enough in you, when you shall
see your Angelical Motions like Lightning, cast down with Confusion
of Fear from their former Perfection of imaginary Glory,
rational Dreams and Visions, Revelations, Inspirations, Experiences,
or Voices proceeding from an incomprehensible Spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, I have both read and heard a Voice to say, that the Secrets
of the Lord are his Choice Treasures, reserved only for Redeemed
ones; but I never read or heard from any Spiritual wise
Man before now, that any Satanical Spirit was able to intellect deceived
Persons, exactly to write of the hidden Mysteries of the Everlasting
<a id='Page_66'></a>God. Again, you pretend unto no such Revelations as I
proceed upon, but say you, there is another Way more certain than
Reason or Revelation, which whether as I presume you were led
into, the Lord will one Day make manifest, from the true Light
of Life Eternal. To this I answer, your Light as terming of the
true Inspirations of the Lord Jesus Christ, written by me to you, is
because as yet his Holy Spirit vails them from your Eyes; but as
for your new Sound of teaching them from your God, more certain
than Reason or Revelation, from the Divine Voice spoken in the
Ear, through the Glorious Mouth of my Lord. I declare that in
all Ages the Elect lost Sheep of <i>Israel</i>, did never read or heard of
any more than two original Ways either Natural or Spiritual in
Mankind, whether you call them Creature or Creator, Light or
Darkness, Truth and Error, Revelation and Reason, Inspiration
and Imagination, Truth and Unbelief, Flesh and Spirit, and such
like.</p>

<p class='c004'>'Tis confess'd, that visible Appearances of God or any else unto
Mortals is teaching of all, but he that expects that kind of
Teaching any more until Men are immortalized, lieth under at
present as great an imaginary Deceit, as ever yet appeared in this
Land. It is also granted that the most holy God speaketh to his
Chosen Messengers by Voice of Words, even to the hearing of the
Ear, unto which Truth for Ends best known unto himself, by his
gracious Power only, can bear Record in this present Generation,
unto the Grief only of all Angelical, Wise, Envious, Proud, Inglorious,
Hypocritical Reprobates that hear of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, yet if your more sure way of teaching from God were
Vision it self, yet it is impossible for you to enjoy any true and lasting
Peace, unless it swallows up all your former Writings produced
from your own Spirit, without an immediate Commission from God,
and in the room thereof, perswade your Soul to pour in your Oil,
into the natural Wounds of oppressed Persons, under what Opinions
or Appearances whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, you say, O Lord God, pity the Captivity of Man, yea,
pity the Captivity of thy own poor Seed, hear the Prayers of that
Spirit that interceedeth with thee for every thing, not according
to any fleshly Imaginations, but according to Truth and Righteousness
of thine one Ballance. From the God of Truth, to this I answer,
concerning that Spiritual Captivity of the Elect, in Reference
of a right understanding of the Creator, you need not trouble yourself
about that, unless you think through much importuning the
<a id='Page_67'></a>unchangeable God, may be perswaded to loose their Bonds before
the decreed time thereof; but if you think that Glory of God's
Eternal Love towards them, will provoke to their Spiritual Darknesses
through the invisible Appearances of his own pure Light,
then you may know, until his own Glorious Season, that all the
Desires of Men or Angels are of no Effect, no nor of the Son himself,
if you imagine a Father besides. 'Tis confess'd, when the
Time draweth near of some great Deliverance of the Chosen
of God, usually the Lord provokes his People to cry unto him
with Sighs and Groans, which cannot be uttered but from the
innocent Spirit of his Spiritual redeemed ones, as his Due, he
may receive all Honour, Praise and Glory for their Deliverance
out of their natural Darknesses, unto his marvellous Light.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, I declare from the true Light of the true God, that the
Spirit which entereth with the Creator for all Mankind, upon the
Account of his Eternal Happiness, was never principled upon a
Spiritual Foundation of Truth, whatever subtile Expressions of
God's righteous Ballance proceedeth from him. Moreover, is it
not the new heavenly Glanses of Christ Jesus in Man's dark
Soul, which upon an immortal Account, becomes all Light, Life,
or ravishing Glory in him; and of the contrary, is it not the absenting
Voice or Virtue of the uncreated Spirit of the Lord Christ Jesus,
that occasions Mens Spirits to be full of Satanical aspiring Wisdom
about the Creator; and whence think you cometh this to pass, or
possible could be of the Spirit, if the Creator were, and Angels
were essentially living in one another there.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, if your literal Request unto the Lord God, as in Reference
unto the miserable Captivity of poor Mankind, lying under
the miserable Yoak of unmerciful rich Tyrants, especially over his
own innocent Seed or chosen People, then this will most necessarily
follow; nay, you cannot deny it, if there be any Light in you, that
all your conceived Spiritual Speakings, or Writings, or Prayers, in
the Great Day of the Lord Jesus Christ, will become but fiery burning
Death in you of utter Darkness, according to the true Saying,
<i>If that Light in you be Darkness, how great is that Darkness</i>. Unless
as before said, answerable to your Profession of Love unto God,
and Pity unto Man, you are a bountiful Reliever of his oppressed
Ones, according to his Bountifulness towards you, then mind the
Virtues of Christ Jesus thus shining in you, will occasion from the
refreshed Bowels of his own Seed new Spiritual Acknowledgments,
and a loving Return in the Lord for you, why because it is rare to
find a merciful rich Man.</p>

<p class='c004'><a id='Page_68'></a><i>Friend</i>, I certainly know that if you are one of God's Elect, you
cannot be offended with me for writing the Truth, though
at present, I be contrary to you in Spirit. Again, you write
that you would beg unto the Lord for me, both with Tears
and Blood, and you would speak somewhat concerning me, but
you are afraid to open the Spirit before the Season thereof. <i>Friend</i>,
As to that if ever the Lord of Life and Glory manifest himself to
your Soul, then you will see clearly the Vanity of those Words.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, if I should tell you, that in the pure Eyes of the
Lord Christ Jesus, that one Handful of your Silver Tears, are of
more Value than a Horse Load of your Tears and Blood, you might
account it a very strange saying from me; truly I unfeignedly believe
it will be found a principal Truth, when our Lord Jesus Christ
shall say in the Day of Judgment, <i>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you, for when I was a hungry, ye fed me;
Go ye Cursed into everlasting Fire, when I was an hungry ye fed me not</i>.
So that without Controversy, there is nothing in Man comparable
to Love, Mercy and Forgiveness, even to his greatest Enemies.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, It is a marvellous thing, if you or any other Man, should
have a Spiritual Gift to distinguish between Divine and Diabolical
Appearances, and yet defer the Examination thereof to another
Season, or did the most wise God ever Commission any Man or Angel
to make a Discovery of any Spiritual Counterfeits, and yet that
Messenger remaineth dark in his own Understanding, concerning
the Creator that sent him. I remember such a like Scripture Saying
as this, <i>him whom you ignorantly worship, declare I unto you</i>. Moreover,
if the most wise Creator, either visible or invisible by himself or
Angel, hath appeared in your Spirit, whereby unto your thinking,
I was clearly discovered as a deceived Person among the rest, is it
not a strange thing that you should have Power over that
Light above Men or Angels, before you for the producing of it
at another Season, the Creator himself will visible make it
manifest, <i>even so come Lord Jesus Christ, for thy glorious Namesake,
come quickly, and in the visible Sight of Men and Angels bear
Record whether thy Holy Spirit sent me (as I have declared almost
these three Years) or no</i>. Again, when the Lord made Choice
of such a simple poor Man as I was, as many can witness in the
City of <i>London</i>, that have known me about these twenty Years,
that I might instrumentally discover the two principal Heads of
mischievous Darkness in the Land; as namely, <i>John Robins</i> past, and
<i>John Tawney</i> almost spent, truly I had no Power in me to put by his
<a id='Page_69'></a>Message until another time; why because (whether you can believe
it or no) his Voice was so Glorious in me, that it shun as the
Sun, and it was of Motion swifter than Thought, and so pleasant
to be declared by Tongue; yet for all that Godlike Glory piercing
in me, and through me, there arose a Desire in me to be eased of
that Burden of the Lord committed to my Charge, because of that
sharp Sentence that I was to declare against any Man that should
despise it; then the Lord spake again unto my Soul, Words of
turning Death, of sensible unutterable Darkness, answerable to
that <i>Jonas</i>-like Rebellion in me, against so great convincing Glory;
and truly I was compelled immediately to cry unto him for Deliverance
from the Wounds or Anguish of my Soul, that I might
presently obey his Word that shined in me with such Light, and
Majesty, and Glory in whatsoever it should command me.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wherefore <i>Friend</i>, happy are you if preserved from slighting an
Appearance, that is contrary unto your Light, though it strike
at the Foundation on which is built all your Spiritual Enjoyments;
for alas, you know in the End, all false Lights will be made
manifest unto those that possess the true Light of Eternal Life in
them; Blessed therefore are those, that in Obedience unto the Creator
from a purified Spirit are compassionate to all Men, but especially
to those innocent Appearances, in the Name of the
Lord, though they all differ in their Declaration for them. If
there be but one true Messenger from the Lord among the rest, they
shall as formerly, receive an Angel of God unawares, and with
him be Partakers of the Glorious Secrets of the everliving God, to
their eternal Consolation: For this I know, from the Spirit of
Truth, that those that are left under a Spirit of rejecting and despising
of false Appearances, coming forth in the Name of the
Lord, they not clearly knowing them to be so, they will as readily
despise a true Messenger of the Lord to their eternal Hurt; wherefore
are all those, that neither Honour nor Life it self is dear unto
them, but upon an Account of Spiritual Wisdom amongst wise
Men, when the Glorious Things of Eternity, though in base Appearance
presented unto them, from that Spiritual Rock of all
Ages, which is our Lord Jesus Christ, God and Man, is one distinct
Body or Person glorified; for whatsoever Men dream from their
imaginary Gods, of two or three Persons, or a vast incomprehensible
Spirit, essentially living in all Things and Places; from an immediate
Voice from the highest Heavens, I positively affirm against
Men or Angels, that there neither is, nor ever was any other God or
<a id='Page_70'></a>Creator, but that God-man Christ Jesus, which was nailed to the
Cross, the which Glorious God will one Day visibly appear with his
mighty Angels, to the Everlasting Terror of those that reject his
Person, as to love a thing for an infinite God to dwell in or to be;
yea this very true God in Opposition to all other Gods, Men, or
Angels, is already come with his invisible pure piercing Light, to
make an everlasting Distinction between the imaginary notional
Mysteries of Men in rational Darkness, and the Spiritual Mysteries
of his everlasting Kingdom, by true Inspirations from an holy and
unerring Spirit. <i>Even so come Lord Jesus Christ, visibly also according
to thine own Word, come quickly.</i> Amen.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c004'>Yours with all the Elect, in that only wise very true God, which
in the Sight of Men and Angels visible appeared in Flesh, and
in that very Body of Flesh and Bone, is ascended far above all Gods,
Heavens, Angels, or Men, and there to remain until the Resurrection
of all elect Things, or the Judgment-Day, whose uncreated Spirit of
fiery Love, is all Variety of immortal Crowns of new ravishing Glories,
prepared for all those that long for his visible appearing, to
make an everlasting Separation, between the merciful Elect, and
unmerciful Reprobate.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
